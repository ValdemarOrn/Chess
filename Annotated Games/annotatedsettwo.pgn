{00031.5.16 Analyzed by National Master Corey Russell} 1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4
dxe4 4. Nxe4 f5 {This is a mistake. This weakens black's king (the e8-h5
diagonal is now open), doesn't develop, and not black is unable to boot a
white piece from e5. He will have to use pieces now to do that. Instead,
simple development like ...Nf6 or ...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 is to be
recommended.} 5. Bg5 {I understand your wish to post a knight on c5, but this
move is dubious. By far, the e5 square is a better outpost. It is a hole in
your opponent's position. A hole is a square that your opponent's pawns can't
cover. c5, on the other hand, can easily be covered by the black b-pawn.
Instead of Bg5, I recommend the following setup to take advantage of black's
weakening by f5: Nc3, Bc4, Nf3, castles short (O-O), and Re1, with a definite
advantage to white because b lack's e6 pawn is a target.} Be7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7.
Nc5 {I recommend 7. Nc3 instead} Nc6 8. d5 {A good rule of thumb to follow is:
don't attack until you've gotten all your knights & bishops out, and you've
castled to safety! Your entire army wants to get involved in the fight. If you
use just a few pieces, you can be overwhelmed if you opponent uses all of his
pieces, kind of like a 3 on 1 fast break in basketball. Instead, Be2 looks
best, so that if black tries to push ...e5, white won't have to worry about a
discovered check, because the bishop would be blocking. After the text, black
could win a pawn by playing 8. ... Qxc5 9. dxc6 Qxc6.} exd5+ 9. Ne2 {This isn't
good. Black is threatening ...Qxc5. White MUST prevent the loss of a piece.
Qe2! does the job! Black can't take the knight since that would expose his
king to check by the white queen on e2, which is illegal. White only loses a
pawn this way. Also, the knight on e2 block's white's bishop from getting out.
This will cause problems later. White's king-knight should be posted on f3
instead, where it helps to control the center.} f4 10. Qd2 {This still hangs a
piece on c5. Nb3, followed by 11. Qd2 (trying to castle-queenside and thereby
free white's e2 knight to move) is the best way to proceed. 10. Qxd5 is
possible, but black can get a lot of tempo (extra moves) on white, so it's
probably not worth it. For example, 10. Qxd5 Nf6 11. Qc4 O-O-O, and now white
can't even castle} Ne5 11. Nxf4 {This should lose, as now black can now win
white's queen by force. Do you see it? Instead, preserving white's c5 piece
with Nb3 is much preferable.} Nc4+ {Oops! Wrong check! Much better for black
is 11. ... Nf3+ 12. Kd1 (forced, since it's double-check) Nxd2 13. Kxd2 Qxc5,
with a crushing position for black.} 12. Be2 {Uh, oh, white returns the favor.
White's queen is in jeapordy, and his king is in check. Is there any move that
will get the queen out of danger, AND block the check? Yes! Qe2! Not only that,
it even indirectly defends white's knight at c5, since the black queen is
pinned to her king. Instead, black procures a large amount of material.} Nxd2
13. Kxd2 g5 14. Nce6 {This should lose immediately after 14. ... gxf4. Notice
if 15. Bh5+ Kd7 16. Bg4 Kd6, and black's king is perfeclty safe.} Qb4+ 15. Kc1
Qxf4+ {Black commits a minor blunder. He's still winning, but white can take
black's queen with 16. Nxf4 gxf4. This would leave black with a piece up,
though his development is severely lagging. This is still far better than what
actually happened for white.} 16. Kb1 Qxf2 17. Rf1 Qxg2 {
There was no reason for black not to dominate the white bishop.} 18. Bb5+ c6
19. Nc7+ Ke7 20. Re1+ Kf6 21. Ne8+ Kf7 22. Nd6+ Kf6 23. h3 {Why not continue
checking with Ne8+? Maybe black will repeat the position 3 times with the same
person to move, and then you can legally claim a draw!} Bxh3 24. Nxb7 {
White's bishop is hanging. Instead, preserving the bishop with say Bd3 is
superior (though black's still winning).} Re8 25. Rxe8 {This ignore's black's
threat of back rank mate. Instead Rc1 would fight on (sort of). Black's
advantage would stil be huge.} Qg1+ 26. Bf1 Qxf1+ 27. Re1 Qxe1# *

{00032.5.17 Analyzed by Candidate Master Daniel Waite Caro-Kann Defense} 1. e4
c6 2. Nc3 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. Ne5 Nf6 5. f4 Bc5 {Both sides have mishandled the
Opening. Black misses the golden opportunity to cramp White "almost"
permanently with /\d4. From now on White has to play "catch up." In some fine
restaurants putting "ketchup" on your steak means the cook did a poor job. In
chess playing "catch up" in the Opening, especially as White, means you've
done a poor job. The move, 5. f4 is "almost" losing. After 5/\d4 the Knight
has to move. The idea for Black is Nxe4, Bd6, and Qc7. This game of "ketchup"
should be fatal for White.} 6. d4 Bd6 {White gets back on track. While the
move 6. d4 is not the best, it is an attempt to put some pressure on the Black
center and keep disaster a move or so further down the line. It stuffs the
Black idea of /\d4. 6. Nd3 is an odd move that seems to work. This strange
move attacks the Bishop and keeps it off b4 at the same time! The problem is
that it is a "one move" solution that blocks the Bishop and will probably have
to move again. The idea is to find as permanent solutions as possible in the
opening. Black now as the golden opportunity to play 6/\Bb4 completely
disrupting the White center.} 7. Bd3 O-O {White misses the simple, and
possibly equalizing, idea of 7. Nxf7! Kxf7 8. e5. Always consider the check. A
check is a free move. How many times would you like to move more than once?
Here is the chance, consider the check - ALWAYS. From the defense's
perspective it helps to not give away free moves.} 8. a3 Bxe5 {White takes
leave of his senses. A lesson in White's mistaken 8th move is to evaluate the
threat before you move. The suspicion is that White is playing 8. a3 for one
of two reasons. Either White does not have an idea [plan] or White fears the
move /\.Bb4. The problem with White's move it is that it opens the door for
Black to capture on e4. Either /\dxe4 or Nxe4 is strong.} 9. fxe5 Nxe4 10. Qh5
Nd7 {Now Black runs out of ideas. I know that it looks like Black should
develop but there are more pressing issues at hand - like survival. The move,
10. Qh5 introduces a very dangerous idea that must keep Black on guard. It is
necessary for black to play /\f5. The result of this is that the Bishop on d3
is permanently taken out of the game. If White tries 11. exf6 [en passant]
then 11/\Nxf6 covers the vital h7 square and tackles the Queen on h5. The
White attack fizzles. This game can be a lesson in handling dangerous ideas
casually. On defense you must be aggressive!} 11. b4 g6 {White "baits" Black
into taking at c3. In the process, White drops the piece. The Black move of g6
is correct.} 12. Qh6 Nxc3 {Black picks up the piece. This is correct. However
there is a short lesson to be learned in this move. Whenever you capture
material, you in essence give something up. In short, you give up two moves
[one to capture the piece and one to put the capturing piece back on the
square you want it]. You must weigh the cost of the time against the material
won. In most cases take the piece but think it through first. If you are in
doubt that you will survive the coming attack - don't grab the material. At
this point the material grab is safe and gives Black a huge advantage.} 13. Bg5
Qc7 {Black loses immediately. Now Black must play 13/\ f6. The best White can
hope for now is the perpetual check [or draw by three-fold repetition].
However the game is far from over. White's initiative is still very dangerous.
For example, 13. Bg5 f6 14. Bxf6 Nxf6 15. exf6 Rxf6. Then there is 15. Bxg6
hxg6 16. Qxg6 Kh8 and White gains the draw by repetition [perpetual check]. On
15 Bxg6 Nce4 16.exf6 Nxf6 17. O-O Qe7 18. Rxf6 Rxf6 Black wins easily. On 14.
exf6 Nxf6 Black should still be safe - but under pressure.} 14. Bf6 Nxf6 15.
exf6 Qe5+ 16. dxe5 g5 {You asked a question at the beginning: "I have been
playing for about 12 years. I have only got serious about my chess in the last
2 years. I have a strong love for chess and I played at least 2 games everyday
for the last 2 years. I don't have a rating, but I feel I am pretty good. I
have no one to play but the computer. So, I am self-taught in everything I
know. please tell me if I'm on the right track." Answer: First, I am glad you
love chess. The fact is that chess is plain fun. I really does not matter what
your skill level is if you can enjoy what you are doing. I did not win a game
the first two years that I played, but I had fun anyway. There are several
ways to gain a chess rating. You can go to United States Chess Federation
rated tournaments. These are official ratings. You can play chess on-line and
gain a rating that is not official but can give you an idea of your strength
[I know these ratings are debatable but/\]. You can play a chess program that
will rate your level of play. Remember that the "rating" is only a measure of
relative strength. As far as being "self taught" is concerned, we all need
help at times. There are many good books that can help teach us. Silman's
"Amateurs Mind" and "How to Reassess your chess" are the best at this point in
complete instructional manuals for most players (under the Master level).
There are many places on-line that offer instruction. If you love chess, then
you will find the study of chess enjoyable when there is no opponent around.
It is also fun to hit your unsuspecting neighbor with something you just
learned in your studies. There is a problem with studying chess, the better
you get the less competitive the neighborhood games become. In other words, it
becomes less fun if you do not have a serious challenge. One method of
correction for this is what my first chess teacher once said, every chess
player has the moral obligation to help teach others the game. Teaching kids
in the schools is a great chance to stretch yourself. About being on the
"right track," that depends on what you want to accomplish. If you want to
beat your neighborhood you are fine. Cut back on the mistakes and learn to
play with your pawns and you will give most of your local friends fits. I
think the critical element in your immediate improvement is to understand pawn
play. In the game as Black, you gave yourself a "Bad Bishop." That is a Bishop
where the central pawns are on the same color as the Bishop. In essence this
is playing a piece down. Part of the reason for the Opening you chose [the
Karo-Cann] is to avoid the bad bishop. For the most part you need to play the
Bishop to f5 before you play /\e6. The Bishop is technically "bad" but it is
active [useful]. Remember that pawn will dictate your strategy both
offensively and defensively. Use them to create space, permanent out posts and
create weakness in your opponent's camp. Remember chess is war, these pawns
are the foot soldiers. You can not win a war without putting troops on the
ground and winning as much space as possible. To get an accurate "track" a
coach would have to examine at least 50 games over several years time period.
What you are looking for is an improvement. By that, look to understand what
mistakes you commonly make. Then eliminate them. This will make you much
stronger by virtue of the fact that you are not helping your opponent! Also
there are set of basic applications that a chess coach will look for that
includes pawn play, piece interaction, and pattern recognition [et. al.]. The
goal is to improve over time. The painful thing is that this process takes a
fearless moral inventory, something that few have the courage to do. Still,
keep at it. Enjoy the game. Teach someone else.} 17. Qxh7# *

f4 g6 4. Nf3 {As you probably know, this position denotes the Grand Prix
attack. With proper play, black would equalize -- though not without its
pitfalls for black.} Bg7 5. Bb5 e6 {?! This gives white a nice game. 5. ...
Nd4! gives black equality. Why, you ask? Several reasons 1) doesn't let white
double black's pawns on c6 2) let's white's bishop stay a target. For example,
6. Nxd4 cxd4 7. Ne2 Nf6 8. d3?? Qa5+ 3) the knight at d4 can't be booted from
d4 by c3, since white's knight occupies that square.} 6. Bxc6 dxc6 7. O-O Ne7
8. d3 Bxc3 {? This severely weakens black's dark squares and his king-side.
More logical is continued development with 8. ... 0-0 9. Be3 b6 10. Qe1 Ba6,
with the idea of ..c4 to undouble black's pawns.} 9. bxc3 Qb6 10. c4 {
! A strong multi-purpose move. Here's what it does: 1) fixes the black c5 pawn,
keeping a target 2) controls d5, so that black can't use that central square
for his pieces when white plays an eventual e5 to create an potential outpost
for white's knight at d6. 3) It evens opens up the a1-h8 diagonal for white's
bishop.} Bd7 11. Be3 Qa5 12. Bd2 Qc7 13. Bc3 Rg8 {Good. You didn't fall for 13.
... O-O? 14. Bf6! Rae8 15. Qe1 with a winning king-side attack.} 14. Be5 {
Dubious. This should've forced black to go to his most active square (...Qa5).
White has a MUCH stronger move instaed -- 14. Bf6! This would put a massive
cramp on black. Black can't mobilize his king-side or center, he can't castle,
and he can't even take white's f4 pawn. (14. ... Qxf4 15 Ne5 with a clear
advantage for white. Try to work it out). White's bishop is a far superior
piece to black's knight at e7.} Qc8 15. Bd6 b6 16. Bxe7 {This isn't bad, but
again -- white's bishop is far superior to black's knight. Why shouldn't white
intensify pressure on the dark squares with Qe1, with the idea of Qh4.} Kxe7
17. e5 b5 18. Qe1 Rh8 19. Qf2 {?! This cashes in too early. White's winning
chances in the middle game are excellent. 19. Ng5 with the idea of Ne4, and
possibly Qh4, leaves white with a great game. Notice that white is pratically
a piece up, because of the limited scope of black's bishop on d7, compared to
white's knight.} Qf8 {! A resourceful move! Black's chances aren't great, but
certainly they are better in the endgame than the middle game. This is because
black's king stuck in the center is a drawback in the the middle game, but an
advantage in an ending.} 20. Qxc5+ Ke8 21. Qxf8+ Kxf8 22. c5 a5 23. a4 {
I don't like this move (though it is okay). I'm sure white's idea was to
create a target on a5 and to create a potential reroute for his knight (Nd2-c4)
, but his was unnecessary since white could always reroute by Nd2-e4. I like
23. a3, keeping white's pawn opposite black's bishop (hence not a target).
Here's a general rule to remember -- the farther advanced a pawn is, the more
vulnerable it is.} b4 24. Nd2 Kg7 25. Nc4 Rhb8 26. Rfb1 h5 27. Rb2 Ra7 28. Rab1

center (e4), this break would not even be possible.} 30. Ke2 Be8 31. exf6+ {
Simply 31. c3 would've won a pawn for white. Note that earlier, c3 wasn't
possible because after the exchange of rooks on b7, black could've played ...
c2! and white could not have stopped the pawn. It doesn't work now, however,
because the white king is within range of the c-pawn.} Kxf6 32. h4 Rd7 33. Nd6
Ra8 34. d4 Rad8 35. Kd3 Rxd6 {Good! I would've done this myself. Passive play

activity of yoru pieces is paramount. 53. ... Bc6! draws by force AND has a
subtle trap. If 54. Kxg6?? b1Q+ 55. Rxb1 Be4+ would force white to resign! And
if white tries Rxb2 instead of Kxg6, then Be4 sets up a fortress. This is a
common motif for the side with less material. White's rook for bishop in that
position would be worthless.} 54. Rxb2 Kxg3 55. Kxg6 {? White throws his win
away. 55. Kg5! preserves the win. The idea is to drive black's king away with
a check on the third rank, then pick off either the e6 or g6 pawn, and finally
to sacrifice the rook at the right moment to get a winning K + P endgame.} Kxh4

{00034.5.19 Analyzed by Candidate Master Daniel Waite For having only a year
of experience you played well. I'm sure by now you have realized that your
demise is due to the loss of the d-file. However, the difficult part is to
figure out how this happened. Let's take a look.} 1. e4 c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. Nc3 {
This is the "Two Knights Variation." It is an attempt to confuse the Caro-Kann
player. Keene considers this "sharp" while Schiller calls it "quiet." How you
handle it is a matter of personality. If you choose to give up the Bishop pair
early you must keep the game "closed." (All four center pawns on the board.)
Thus, when the d-file opens you invite trouble. h3 Bxf3Qxf3} e6 {Solid, but/ \.
As a defender you must be aggressive. You also have the option to transpose
into more familiar territory with 3/\.dxe4 4. Nxe4 5. Bf5. Also a tempting
idea between moves 3 through 9 is the move /\d4. This is an attempt to close
the center and gain space on the Queenside. Again this is a matter of
personality. My favorite way of attacking the Two Knights Variation is to play
5/\Nf6 if 6. e5 then the center will be permanently locked giving you the
chance to make your Knights better than the opponent's Bishops. You can choose
between Nfd7 and Ne4. If White tries 6.d5 then 6/\dxe4. The idea is that Black
gains a move (tempo) 7.Qe3 e6 (The d4 pawn is undefended if 7.Nxe4 Qxd4.). Now
after the exchange on e4 the Queen Knight heads for d5 through d7 and f6. The
idea is to plant the Knight securely on d5, making it, in theory better than
the White Bishop pair.} 4. d3 Nf6 {Here is the chance to create some
interesting possibilities. For instance 6/\.d4 7. Ne2 Qb6. White is forced to
commit to some sort of stand on the Queenside. One idea would be to play 8. c3.
The problem with this idea is that Black is not developed properly. The "total
war" that will develop is going to be difficult.} 5. Bd2 c5 {While not objectiv
ely unsound, 7/\.c5 invites many problems. Here the problem again is the lack
of development. Typically in these pawn positions Black is going to want to
play /\Bd6 and /\Nd7 before /\c5. Even stronger is if Black can also achieve a
Rook on the c - file. Now consider the possibilities of 7/\. Nbd7 8. O-O-O Bd6.
Now Black can try to "clear and seal" with /\c5 and /\d4. The concept involves
clearing the Knight from it's defensive post and using the pawn structure to
seal off the opponents pieces on the opposite side of the board. This takes
courage because you will need to castle on the opposite side and attack
without counting the cost (sacrifice almost everything if necessary). However,
you do get to isolate the King away from any reinforcements.} 6. g4 Nc6 {
O-O-O  Be7  The question for you to answer will be the pawn charge on the g -
file. You might want to experiment with the Sicilian Dragon. After facing the
Yugoslav Attack, you will loose the fear of these pawn charges. Even here you
can play 9/\d4. A good rule is to always play in the center (e and d files).
When you face an attack on the wing (side) become active in the center.
Generally the stronger of the attacks will occur in the center.} 7. g5 dxe4 8.
dxe4 Nd7 9. h4 Nd4 {Qg3 Qb6} 10. Ne2 Bd6 {f4 0-0-0} 11. Bc3 Nxe2 {16. Bc3? Afte
r building a strong initiative, with a little help from your passive game,
White plays a poor move. 16. Nxd4 cxd4 17. e5 Bc7 looks more interesting for
White. With the d - file open and the Knight planted on d4 Black can easily
equalize with 16/\e5. If 17. Bxd4 cxd5 gains a strong initiative for Black.
Even 17. Nxd4 exd4 neuters the Bishop and gets you back into the game. With
this exchange Black accomplishes several of White's major goals. (As much as
possible, do not help your opponent. Never force your opponent to do something
that you will regret!) First, Black opens the d - file White's only means of
attack. Second Black opens the long diagonal (a1- h8) for White, in effect
giving White the center. Finally, Black opens (abandons) the center. Once you
post a Knight in your opponent's territory keep it there or make the opponent
sacrifice (or pay a high price) to get rid of it. The reward for this is that
White will seize the d - file and disrupt Black's "key ranks" (the 1,2,7,8
ranks) with the Bishops.} 12. Bxe2 Qc7 13. Rf1 Rg8 14. Bd3 g6 {
Qf2 Rde8  Kb1  Nb8} 15. Bb5 {Nc6  Bf6} a6 16. e5 Be7 {Giving up the Bishop is
a new concession that in effect looses the game. The Bishop was the only piece
that was keeping the Black Rooks from invading your territory. One general
idea is for the defender to trade off attacking pieces. However, that
guideline is wrong in this situation. Principle: You must do what the position
demands. Do not just follow general ideas or try to force your will on the
position. You can still fight on after 24/\ Bf8.  Bxe7  Rxe7 Bxc6 Qxc6 Rd6 Qc7
Rfd1 Kb8 R1d3  c4  R3d4  c3  b3 Rc8 A nating idea at this point is 31/\.Qa5.
Black's move 31....Rc8 does not help. Rc4  Qa5  Rxc8+ Kxc8 Qa7 Qc7 Now for a
review. Black allowed White to capture the d - file. This was complicated by
giving up the strong Knight at d4 and sealed by giving up the Bishop guarding
d6. Your weak points seem to be the lack of control of the central squares,
lack of understanding pawn play, and (I suspect) the inability to understand
the board position. Now for the good: somehow you managed to maintain your
balance in a difficult position. You came up with a creative attacking idea
(29/\.c4) when you needed it. With a solid understanding of the position and
your creativity you will be a tough opponent for anyone. Suggestions: Focus
your game on the center. I'd suggest that you attack the center with
simplifying ideas such as closed pawn structures or open (no pawns in the
center) games. You may want to consider charting the pawn structures in your
games. For instance, you may do better in positions without center pawns. I
would suggest that you explore more aggressive openings - especially gambits.
While you are charting your games give careful attention to when you make your
errors. For instance in this game you could mark moves 16 and 24 as major
errors. When you come up to your common problem moves, give yourself extra
time to think through your move and remind yourself of your weaknesses. Keep
up the good work. Honestly analyzing your games will bring fast improvement.

position. BTW, this looks like one of those moves a computer would make.} Bd4 {
Chess lesson #1: Black takes advantage of a "pivot point." This is the
square(s) that the Bishop uses to attack the same side of the board that it
sits on. Often we see a Bishop cutting across a diagonal but the real danger
comes from these pivot points where suddenly it is attacking back across the
grain. This move is brought to you courtesy of your lack of development.} 14.
Re2 {Now your Rook is not on the back row. There is nothing to defend against
the back row checkmate. Whenever there is a weak King position, look for a
tactical shot. c3 Ouch, this is probably the only move that looses. You should
have tried Bg5, Bf4, Nc3, or Nd2. When your opponent has this much development
on you, you can not afford the time to chase pieces. Besides, c3 does nothing
to move the Bishop of the "dangerous diagonal" (the diagonal that bears down
on your f2/f7 square). You are completely lost at this point. Chess lesson #2:
Development is more important than breathing! Chess in a sense is a war game
where you must mobilize your troops. If you do not, you insure an easy game
for your opponent. Again, this is another computer like mistake. Play more
live opponents. Chess lesson #3: Pattern recognition. First, your King is on
the back row with no breathing room. Second, you have to deal with the open
files. The one that is going to seal your fate is the d - file. (Chess lesson
#4: Always play in the center.) Your opponent puts together two common
patterns. Bxe4 Pattern #1: The decoy. This decoy had the added bite of
actually creating extra possibilities on f2. Pattern #2: Clearing the file.
Both of these are simple to see if you know your patterns. Invest time on
learning these basic patterns. Qxf2} Rxf2 15. Rxf2 {Ng4 Chess lesson #5:
Imbalances. An imbalance is any difference in the position. At this point you
are 2 Bishops & Rook verses Queen and Pawn. Not bad as far as material is
concerned. However, look at how the Knight dominates both your Bishops and
Rook. This is called the "superior minor piece." In spite of your material
differences, you are playing a virtual Rook, Knight, and Bishop down (pieces
that have not been developed). Black also has his pick of the d - file, the f
- file, and the a7 - g1 diagonal. Nd2 c6 h3 Nxf2 Kxf2 Qb6+ Ke2 Qb5+ Bd3} Qg5
16. Kf1 Rf8 {Nf3 Qg3} 17. Be2 e5 {Bh6} 18. Rf5 {Rd1} Qf4+ {Be3 This move is
not possible - the Bishop can not move though the Queen on f4. Thus I'm
assuming the correct move was 28/\Qh4. Chess lesson #6: Pins. Somewhere I read/
heard that 80% of Master level games are decided by a pin. In this case the
pin is "absolute." In other words you can not move the pinned piece. (A
"relative" pin is when you can move the pinned piece - at the cost of what's
behind it.) You must deal with a pin immediately if not sooner! There are
three ways to do this: move the piece that is behind the pin, attack the
pinning piece, and impose another piece in-between. For instance, look at the
common "relative" pin of a Black Bishop on g4, White Knight on f3 and Queen on
d1. You can move the Queen, "question the Bishop" with h3 (which generally
leads to an exchange), or play Be2 (freeing the Knight and the Queen). Bc4+
Kf8 Bc5+ Ke8 Re1 Kd8 Rd1+ Kc7 Be6 Chess lesson #7: Never resign! You can not
win if you resign. You have a combination of interesting ideas available to
you. First, your opponent is crushing you like a bug - you have him just where
you want him. Second, you have two Bishops on a very open board and a Rook
sitting on an open file. The conditions are ripe for a major league swindle.
Possible over-confidence or carelessness can sometimes be used to steal a
point. Try 35. Rd7+, if Black carelessly moves 35/\Kc8 you force mate. If 35.
Rd7+ Kb8 36. Bd6 again tempting /\Kc8 forcing mate (37. Bc7+ Kd8 38. Rc8#).
Develop a reputation for being dangerous when you are cornered. If chess is a
war, it is not an honorable one. You must try every filthy, disgusting, ugly,
swindle opportunity the board position gives you. Just be a gentleman and
don't gloat, laugh or put down your opponent. There is a difference gritty
chess and bad sportsmanship. exf3 resign} *

aggressive openings up until they are over the 1500 mark. From 1500 - 1800
they learn the Colle - K. It/^s good for handling better opponents with
explosive possibilities. After 1800 I require them to play the Torre and
introduce them to the Queen/^s Gambit. The Colle introduces the player to

White at this point has control of the game and has all the possibilities. It
is more or less a matter of time. These are excellent training positions. Now
how will White cash in on his dominance? Nbd4 Ouch. Between the next four
moves you demonstrate that you do not understand the position. Consider Be3
with the idea of Bc5. Also consider Qg3 with the idea of Bxh6. When you are up
positionally, look for ways to tie the opponent/^s position down more. Look
for the most forcing moves. The two redeeming factors are that Black is
uncoordinated and White has both Bishops controlling the Kingside. Nxc6 Bxc6
Be3 Rc8 Qh4 You completely miss the point of the position. You must learn to
read the position! You have complete dominance on the Kingside thanks to your
Bishops. You have complete control of the dark squares thanks to Black/^s lack
of dark square Bishop. You are playing a virtual piece up thanks to the bad
Black Bishop. You have a fine out post for the Knight on d4. How can you take
advantage of these ideas? First you can try 24. Bb6 Qc7 25. Nd5. Now you can
consider Nxe6 prying open the middle and giving you a passed pawn. With the
two active Bishops White should finish Black off quickly. This is one of those
double-edged moves. I like it because it sets up an interesting defense but
Black mishandles it and never uses the idea.} 10. g4 {f4  Black/^s losing move.
The idea of /\Be8 was to play /\Bg6, which looks like it stabilizes the
position - for now. Bd4 When in control, keep it patient and simple. When
behind the defense must be patient but also active. Many times, the defense
wants to complicate a position in hopes that he opponent will lose the way. An
idea that would be very difficult to risk in OTB play would be 26. Bxf4. In
postal, I would have given it a try. The trade is to give Black the White
Queenside in exchange for an attack on the Black Kingside. This will work if
you get the King (which might prove difficult). However if you don/^t get the
King, you have given Black a huge end game advantage. Always play with an eye
on the endgame. At this point, I like your choice.} g5 {Rf7  Black makes his
second losing move. The Bishop at e8 is badly placed now. It keeps the Queen

Rook at f7). Qg4 Kh8} 11. Kh1 {One of my third grade students asked, (+) Why
didn/^t he take the pawn?[+] White misses the (+)crush[+] 29.Qxe6. Through out
this game you have made life interesting for Black then let him off the hook
due to not understanding the position. It is true that at this point anything
short of divine intervention will probably not help Black. However, you must
catch these opportunities if you want to move to a higher level. Against a
seasoned opponent the outcome of this game would have been different. Rg1  Rf8
b4  Rg8 Interesting. 31/\ h4 prolongs the agony. gxh6 gxh6 Suggestions #1:
Work on your positional understanding. A big area to focus on would be
superior minor pieces. In this game you never made use of your Bishops - they
tended to be glorified pawns. They are key in the Colle - K. If you don/^t use
them, you need another opening! Suggestion #2: Consider a more flexible
opening such as the Torre or Colle - Zukertort. (+)Forcing[+] openings tend to
be (+)one idea[+] openings. One of the dangers of (+) forcing[+] openings is
the guys that write the books make us think that all we have to do is
understand the ideas behind the openings. Unfortunately the idea may be
completely misguided in a given concrete situation. Where ideas come to force
is in flexible openings where you can often put two or more ideas together to
create complicated patterns of pressure. In this game you were patient which
should serve you well if this is your general tendency. Suggestion #3: Lost
games are more valuable than won games for learning (analyzing a won game is
not as useful). Compile a file of lost games (50 or more) and examine them for
common errors. This will include where the error was made (keep a close look
out for transitions). When you see a (+)losing[+] move try to figure out the
circumstances that brought you to this place. Some losing moves are a result
of a series of bad ideas or a lack of understanding the position. You can
frame your wins. Suggestion #4: Force yourself to calculate one more move.
Play based on concrete positions, not general ideas (use them only to get
ideas, after that, calculate, calculate, calculate). When it seemed that you
started to do this you played much better. It will also help you to take
bigger risks. Qxg8++} *

Typically White will unleash a strong Kingside attack with Qg4.} 4. e5 c5 5. a3
cxd4 $5 {This move makes sense. Objectively it may be questionable but it
offers Black two pluses. First it gives Black the half-open c - file. Second
it breaks up the White center pawns. One reason for questioning this move is
that it does not appear to be consistent with the objectives of Black's choice
of opening. Always remember there is a plus in every negative on the
chessboard. Chess is an exchange of advantages and disadvantages. For instance,
if you drop a piece you generally get two moves in exchange for it. Sometimes
the two moves are more critical than the piece. It is the reason that
sacrifices work. That is why chess coaches warn younger players to not chase
pawns. It is not worth the moves that are given up. In the games that I've
seen, it appears that Black wants a quick resolution to the game by choosing
this move.} 6. Qxd4 Bxc3+ {Interesting try for Black, typically the play would

that there is an absolute truth at work. Wrong moves should be punished by
accurate play.} 7. Qxc3 Nc6 8. Bb5 {At this point the idea would be to play
Qg3. The forcing of the /\g6 gives White a huge positional advantage with the
pawn at e5 and the absence of the Black's dark square Bishop. If Black castles
Kingside he should not be able to defend himself. Nf3} d4 $2 {This move is too
ambitious at this point. Now Black will be stuck with an over-extended pawn.
In the French, Black must defend first, THEN attack. Development was essential
on move 9. Again a move that makes sense. 9/\d4 is not as bad as you think.
The move is not an "attack." Pawn moves are seldom for purposes of "attack."
As a general rule, the idea of the pawn move is to gain or control space. I do
however agree that this move is ill timed and too ambitious. In a sense the
pawn is sacrificed for open lines. The problem for Black is that these open
lines benefit White! BTW, in every defense the idea is to "defend first, THEN
attack." All attacks must have positional justification. Black does have a
problem unraveling his development in the French Defense - your opponent
compounds this natural problem. This is why I do not personal recommend the
French Defense you young players. If you are interested in completely
frustrating someone playing the French Defense try the "Exchange Variation."
It takes all the fun out of it for Black.} 9. Qd3 Nge7 10. Bg5 {Black's develop
ment is now becoming less effective because his pieces are being pinned and
becoming useless. Black is cramped but at this point is fine. Do not mistake a
cramped position for a bad position. Some defenses are specifically designed
to make maxim use of as little space as possible. These can be very tough to
crack and if the attacker relaxes or mishandles the position, it could get
real ugly real fast. One characteristic of a cramped position is the
interlocking of pieces. This is called "over protection." The idea is that for
every attacker on a piece there is at least one more defender. This makes the
various pieces more flexible - you can move any defender and not give up
material. About pins: You place a high value on them for good reason. Pins
often decide the game! There are two types of pins. There is the "absolute"
pin. These are pins where the first piece can not move because the King is
behind it. Then there is the "relative" pin where the defender can choose to
give up material. The difference is that the second is flexible while the
first is not. The "magic" behind the pin is the inflexibility of the pinned
piece and generally its' defender. With one piece you can tie up as many as
three defenders! That's like playing a virtual piece or two ahead. Another
thing to like about pins is that they can quickly become a permanent
positional advantage. Once you get a pin, work on the front piece - start
piling up the attack on it.} a6 {Missing /\Qa5+ and /\Nxe5. The stronger of
the two would be /\Nxe5, completely dissolving the White center and freeing
Black's game. The draw back is that it scrambles the Black pawns and leaves
White with a 2 - 3 pawn island advantage. The question is if a free game and
an advantage in the center would be worth it?} 11. Bxc6+ {Bxc6 0-0-0 0-0 Black

Black! My intuition kept nagging at me to play 15. Bf6, so I had to use almost
half of my time to give the gut feeling a green light. You knew better,
generally your first instincts are correct. The old rule of thumb is "long
analysis is wrong analysis" at the board. This drops a piece. Let's examine
why the move is not good. First, it gives away the Bishop for a pawn without
time advantage. Second, it does not force anything. When you sacrifice it must
be forcing. Black is not obliged to capture. gxf6 Qg3+ Ng6 Here Black, in
essence, blunders the game away. 16/\Kh7 17. exf6 Ng6 and Black is home free

up the Exchange. You got that right! Qxg6+ Kh8 Qxh6+ If I couldn't find an
absolute win, I knew I could at least give perpetual check. Attitude check.
When you have your opponent in your sights never, never, never consider the
draw. In fact, never consider a draw until you are absolutely sure the
position is completely lifeless - or you are tricking your opponent out of
half a point. Even in completely lost positions there is value in playing them
out - you learn a lot by the hard spots in life. Don't pass up your best
learning opportunities. Kg8 Qg6+ Kh8 Re3 Bxg2 The only move that can prevent
an immediate mate by 22. Rh3+ Rg1! Rg8?? Congratulations! You finished with a
good score. In this game you took advantage of your opponents weakness/
mistakes. You were also aggressive and willing to take a risk. You must study
the "positional" aspects of the game. To attack you must have positional
justification. To sacrifice material you should have concrete analysis all the
way through to checkmate. Also when you sacrifice focus on forcing moves. You
showed excellent insight into some ideas in the game and you made sure your
position was solid. Once you get a grip on the positional essence and learning
how to read the board, you'll be a match for just about anyone under the
Master level. Qh6#} *

Queen/^s Pawn game with 1/\d5.} 2. c4 {Bb4+? Unnecessarily restrictive. The

exchange on c3 can only benefit white. Bd2 Bxd2?! Not the best continuation
here either. Much more logical is 3/\Qe7, when 4. g3 Nf65. Bg2 0-0 6. 0-0 and

ion. Tobe considered as stronger, however, is 5. g3 with a kingside
fianchettogradually building up the position. Attempts to retain the
initiative with 5. d5 Nce7 6. dxe6 dxe6 onlysucceed in helping black mobilize.
Opening the position early like this without the development to back it up can
lead to disaster. Nxe4} d5 $2 {The first blunder. The e-file was already white/
^s avenue of attack as long as the blackking is in the center. Weakening
thee-file for white even further does not help matters. Not only is the e-pawn
weak, but the king is weak! Much better was the obvious 7/\Nf6 with acastle
kingside. Nc5?! A questionable move. Certainly the knight cannot establish
himself here. It would seem as though this warrior wouldlike to fight on black/
^s weak side of the board, the kingside. 7. Ng3 would be begging to be played.
Now, Black can solidify with 7/\Nge7! 7/\Nge7 kept things together in
excellent order for blackwith the idea of 0-0 and Nf5 followed by Qd6
solidifying with chances. Also, eventual e5 advances would begin to become
feasible. There/^s no reason to immediately chase the knight away from its
post. Nb3 Bb7? A blunder. Black may feel obligated to play that move because
of b6, however it is imperative thathe castle as soon as possible. Therefore,
8/\Nge7! with the idea of 0-0 Nf5 and Nce7 would be indicatedfor Black.
Another possible move, evenmore aggressive perhaps, is 8/\Qf6!? threatening
Nge7 with even stronger forceas the ideas dxc4 followed by Nd5 are now
possible. After the text white can pick which side of the board to play
on(queenside, center, kingside) as he has prospects in each area.} 4. Qd2 $2 {
White could choose to play in the center which would revolvearound attacking
the e-pawn and controlling the e-file most like starting withideas like 9. Qe2.
White could chooseto play on the queenside (now that black played b6) because
of the ideainvolved with 9. c5! (making the b7 bishop look pretty ridiculous)
and Rc1, a strongidea, with invasion on the c-file. Lastly, the kingside where
black/^s king remains open. Moves such as 9. Bd3 come to mind. D2 is a poor
square for the queen as she is not involved inany real plan and she/^s exposed
to attack on this square (Ng8-f6-e4) etc. Passivity resembles this move. Black
still does have to deal with thesomewhat distant threat of Bd3 followed by Ng5
with a fork on the h and epawns. However, intending Ng5 so theknight can be
protected from the queen at d2 is a poor reason to play themove. With correct
play, Black could/^vepounced on this. Allows white to develop with tempo with
subsequent pressureon the new isolated e-pawn. It/^s toobig of a trade-off
between all these cons and the one and only pro of morebishop activity. 9/
\Nf6! was the indicatedmove. Bxc4 Here, it doesn/^t take a Garry Kasparov or
Vishy Anand to seethat white is well ahead in position. Space advantage, more
piece mobility, a lead in development, attackingchances, the list could go on
and on. The main trump black holds is the long diagonal and the d-file. But
use of these means doesn/^t leave as goodof impression as White/^s. In an
inferior position, Black picks the worst way possibleto defend the pawn. 10/
\Qf6 would/^vebeen indicated. Ng5! I personally would/^ve castled kingside
first to increasepressure with Re1 as well, but one can hardly call the text
an error. A game-losing blunder. If Black intended to sacrifice the isolated
e-pawn, he should/^ve done sowith 11/\Nf6. Now the position becomeswide open
and tactics loom left and right. Only the better developed, fully-mobilized
side can profit from this.} Na5 $1 {bxa5 Nxe6 Bxe6 Bxe6 Qe7 d5?! Much superior
to the text is of course, 15. 0-0. Not bad at all. Thelong awaited Nf6!
However, here thecapture on e6 would/^ve been a stronger preparatory
combination to the text.} *

Nf3 Nc6 4. d4 cxd4 {Interesting idea to play 4.d4. Bb5 and Bc4 are also
possible here. Black heads into the "Little Center." Several idea to attack
this center would be to get in f5, Bxe6, Nxe6, Nd5. The move e5 can also be
disruptive to the Black center. Another common idea for attacking this set up
is to play c4. There are two essential elements here. First, prevent Black
from freeing himself with /\d5. Second, play the KB to the a2 - g8 diagonal
(Bobby Fischer). This opportunistic diagonal has paid rich rewards to many
players. Key squares for White are d5 and e6. White tends to attack on the
Kingside, while Black aims at the Queenside. Control these and win. Black
meanwhile wants to pressure the pawn at e4 (and support /\d5). Black's main
strategy tends to be to head to the endgame as soon as possible (the pawn
structure favors Black in the endgame). All this would fit into the idea of
playing 4.d4} 5. Nxd4 d6 6. Be2 Be7 7. O-O Nf6 8. Bg5 O-O 9. Qd2 Qb6 {
9/\Nxe4 10. Nxe4 Nxd4 11. Qxd4 Bxg5 12. Qxd6 Be7 should give Black a safe
comfortable game after 13. Qxd8 Rxd8. Meanwhile 13. Qg3 Qb6 gives Black
persistent pressure thanks to the Bishop pair.} 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Rab1 Rd8 12.
Rfd1 Qc7 13. Qf4 h6 {Also worth considering is 13. Bf3.} 14. Bh4 g5 {
14/\g5?? Ouch. Black risks opening the Kingside.} 15. Bxg5 hxg5 {An idea for
Black would be 15/\e5. But, I'm not sure this gains much over the game.} 16.
Qxg5+ Kh8 17. e5 {Sweet. This is one of those killer positional ideas that few
young players would consider. If you keep up with the positional excellence/\
Anyway, White blocks Black's ability to defend the Kingside. Either there will
be doubled e - pawns or black will have to give up material. Rxd8+ Bxd8 Rd1}
Bb7 18. Bd3 {Ouch. A common idea after the g and h pawns have vanished is to
get a Rook to the one of the files. The "perfect" move is to play 20. Rd3.
After this I don't think that Black can defend himself. For instance, Black
has two moves that make sense 20/\Nh7 and 20/\Qe7. On 20/\Nh7 21. Qh5 c5 22.
Rh3 f5 23. Qe8+ Kg7 24. Qxe6 shatters Blacks pawns and exposes Black to all

Nxe4. Then there is 22..Nh7 23. Qxe5+ f6 24. Qxe6. From this point on White's
game begins to deteriorate. Black must have been very happy at this point.
Qh6+ Kg8 Qg5+ Kf8 Qh6+ Ke7 Qg7 e4 Bc4 Qe5 Nb5 Bc7 Also working is 26/\e3.
Stronger is 26/\Bd5 27. Be2 e3 g3 Your strength, in this game, is a strong
positional feel that is rare in young players. You seem to have two weaknesses.
First, you do not demonstrate a willingness to attack, even though you had
positional justification. This tends to come from lack of experience and lack
of knowing basic attacking motifs. Second, you don't seem to understand the
idea of the opening. (Very few do, in OTB. Play postal and you will learn the
ideas very quickly or lose badly, quickly.) I would suggest that you switch to
the Queen's Gambit to capitalize on your positional awareness. Work on the
common tactical ideas, learn patterns. Maybe one thing that will help you in
the area of attack is to pick up a gambit as a "change up" style (what you
pull out for fun or when you've been scouted at a tourney). This will add
spice (not to mention confusion) to your opponent's life. If you want to work
on your positional understanding, study the games of Karpov - who just happens
to be creative attacker. (I can hear the laughter of those who have never
studied his games.) Also read Silman's "How to Reassess" book, if you haven't
done so already. When all else fails, I'm looking for new students! (LOL) e3} *

{00042.6.05 Analyzed by Candidate Master Charles Oberweiser This is my friend,
Tim Smith's, exhibition game before the actual tournament. This was not at
tournament time controls (40 moves/120 minutes, 20 moves/60 minutes, and 30
minutes), but it was at 90 minutes for each side for all moves. I was at this
tournament with him and helped him prepare his openings for the psychological
aspect of his opponent.} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {We thought this would be
our best weapon against Tom because he tends toward the Hungarian opening, an
opening that begins a stream of tactical ideas that usually favor white. We
wanted to accentuate the fact that Tim is a Kasparov-like calculator.} Be7 {
Sure enough. He played the Hungarian. Everything's according to plan.} 4. d4
exd4 $6 {We didn't expect this. This is an inferior move because it allows the
white e-pawn to drive back the black pieces. 4. d6 is indicated completing
development.} 5. c3 $5 {Tim usually plays the sharp 5. 0-0 here, but he
surprised his opponent. This gives the game numerous complications.} Nf6 $2 {
Tim quoted in post-game analysis, "I'm surprise he played this move. In order
to not lose tempi he must weaken his kingside. Right from this moment I knew
my game plan." Better was 5. Na5 taking advantage of the exposed position of
the white bishop where white would respond with 6. Qxd4.} 6. e5 $1 {Punishing b
lack's inaccuracy the first time he gets a chance. This pawn needed to be
restrained with d6 before the king's knight would come out a la Nimzovich.} Ne4
7. Bd5 $1 {This move prevents d5 to protect the newly-attacked e4-knight so
Black has to weaken his kingside in order to not lose tempi.} f5 $6 8. cxd4 {
A simple glance at the position will show that white has built up a strong
mobile center. Black needs to attack it at once or he will risk being crushed.
White's main problem is the e4-knight.} Bb4+ $6 {Moving the same piece twice
allowing White to build up time (development) and initiative. While this isn't
a huge blunder in itself, it can be pounced on in the long run with accurate
play. Better was 8. Nb4 (I know, moving the same piece twice again, but this
time it's dislodging the central bishop in order to get the strong 9. d5! with
counterplay). Also better than the text is 8. d6 cracking at the white center,
though succumbing to the shot 9. Qa4!.} 9. Bd2 {
Giving up the two bishops for an advantage in time.} Nxd2 10. Nbxd2 Ne7 $2 {
Moving an already-developed piece once again. One may be thinking it's
attacking the bishop so it's all right, but in this position due to black's
open king and his newly undefended bishop, Tim came up with a tactic that
gains considerable advantage while eliminating black's right to castle. It
must be said, however, that if Black continues correctly he could establish a
strong knight at d5. However, in the opening, there usually isn't time for
these kind of maneuvers. Tim suggested 1. 0Ra5 or 10. g5 ascreatingcounterplay
for Black. He didn't provide the line for 10, g5 which leaves me speculative,
but I agree with 10. a5 for sure. Though 10. g5 11. a3 Ba5 12. Nh4 Bxd2+ (if
12. gxh4, then mate in two with 13. Qh5+!) 13. Kxd2 g4 does look good for
black now that I take a second look.} 11. Bf7+ $1 Kxf7 12. Qb3+ Ke8 $6 13. Qxb4
a5 $2 {This move does not help development nor does as much constructive work
as it would've done on move 10. This is black's first major mistake. Tim
mentioned to me that, "13. b6 was undoubtedly the best move because 13. d6
fails due to the fact it opens up the position while the black king is in the
center and 13. d5 obviously fails because it produces the well-protected
passed e-pawn that's ready to push after 14. 0-0 and 15. Rfe1. 13. b6 is the
only solid way to develop because white's pressuring black to a huge extent
due to the powerful center built up." I agree. 13. b6 followed by 14. 0-0 Bb7
15. Rfe1 Nd5 (hopping into the fine outpost blockading the advance of the
d-pawn) and black doesn't stand as badly.} 14. Qc4 d5 15. Qc3 f4 $6 {Black real
ly was in time trouble which is why, I think, that these blunders are
occurring in a row like this. Nothing called for an immediate 15. f4. Better
was the slow buildup with 15. Rf8.} 16. Rc1 $6 {Keeping the initiative going.
White probably should've castled first and played Rfe1 in order to get the
e-pawn rolling right away.} c6 17. O-O Rf8 $2 {Giving white everything he
could want. Straying from anything logical. White has so many threats right
now, that one would think black would need to defend against a few. 17. Qb6 is
a much stronger move to the text with pressure down the b-file and on white's
center.} 18. Rfe1 {Continuing his plan.} h6 $2 {Tim said to me in an email,
"18. h6? was a computer-like move that intends 19. g5 and prevents white
playing Ng5. To tell the truth, I was expecting either 18. a4 (preventing
Nb3-c5) and Qc7 intending a c5 push after due preparation or 18. Kf7 manually
creating a castled position. After 18. h6 I knew he's not able to create a
safe place for his king for the rest of the game." I believe that 18. h6 was a
rather inaccurate move as well. More active were the ones that Tim indicated
and 18. Rf5!?.} 19. Rcd1 {The main idea here is to over protect the base of
white's center (d4) to allow the white knight at d2 to make it's way to c5.
Even better was probably 19. Re2 (to allow the knight retreat to e1-d3-c5 if
the opportunity arises itself) g5 20. h3 (now intending Nh2-g4 and eliminating
all black counterplay) Rg8 21. Nh2 and white has a great game. The text has
the drawback of allowing black to create something on both wings.} Bf5 {
Developing his bishop, but allowing 20. Nb3 without problems. Better was 19.g5.
} 20. Nh4 $6 {Tim mentioned to me that this move was mainly due to time
pressure because he blitzed this one out. He admitted, "I missed the stronger
line 20. Nb3 b6 21. Nc1 g5 22. Ne2 Rc8".} Bg4 21. Rc1 g5 {21. Be6 was more
useful than the text at this point because it blockades white's strong e-pawn.}
22. Nhf3 {This proves that white knew he made a mistake because he had nothing
else in store for this knight here.} Bf5 $2 {This move didn't impress me. Much
more logical would be 22. Rg8 or 22. Be6 (again, blockading the passed e-pawn
and getting out of the way for g4).} 23. h3 {
A useful move. It makes g4 less tempting and allows for Nh2. A nice idea.} b6
24. Qa3 $1 {Changing direction to the weak d6 square.} Rc8 $2 {Not the way to
respond, much too defensive. However, there are immediate concerns that need
to be considered like the h-pawn and a cancer spreading in his own territory!
Better was 24. Be6 or 24. Qd7.} 25. Qd6 $1 {Excellent move. The queen radiates
her majesty's powers in all directions making black extremely uncomfortable.
Black has nothing except defense now.} Bg6 26. Nh2 $3 {Beautiful! I was proud
of my friend here and surprised. He thought for 10 minutes in a 90 minute game
on this move. This is a Karpov-type move when he's more of a calculating
player. Here he's bringing more pieces into the battle. Heading for f6 while
his counterpart heads for f3.} Kf7 $1 {A fine defensive move as well. It makes
sure the bishop stays put and tries to find safety. If Black tried the
resource 26. h5, Tim told me he planned 27. Ndf3 which would be a strong
response. What made the white queen at d6 so powerful is that it couldn't be
exchanged without the loss of a piece and a powerful white passed pawn at e7.
After 26. Kf7! now exchange is possible.} 27. e6+ {The in between move. White
realizes he needs to retreat his queen, but he wants to push the passed pawn
to be a thorn in black's flesh first. Strong alternatives to the text were 27.
Ng4 threatening 28. Nxh6+ and 27. Ndf3! Kg7 28. Ng4 Nf5 , and then 29. Qa3
retreating and White has a strong attack going. As a matter of fact, the
latter alternative looks stronger than the text.} Kg8 28. Qa3 $6 {White should'
ve just retreated to e5 on his 28th move. It creates more threats. In post
game analysis, Tim mentioned to me what he was thinking during the game here,
"At this point I was nervous. I said to myself, 'what have I done'. Here black
had a brilliant defense, 28. Bf5! followed by 29. Kg7 and black solidifies."
In a post-mortem 28. Re8 also looks interesting for black.} Qc7 $2 {This neglec
ts the g4 square as well as all the other important squares on the kingside.
He's intending c5, but I don't know what that does for him.} 29. Ndf3 $1 c5 $4
{Again, I don't understand what this does for Black. Much better is 29. Bf5.
All this does is opens up a diagonal for the white queen after the capture at
c5. This is a game-losing blunder.} 30. Ne5 $6 {This is a good move, but it's
not the best. 30. Ng4! is a powerful shot that gives white the winning game
and after 30. Kh7 31. dxc5! (a clearance capture for use of the a1-h8 diagonal)
bxc5 32. Qc3 he has a powerful attack. He saw this immediately in analysis
afterwards, but during the game, with //time ticking down, he missed it. With
the knight moving to e5 it's not doing it's job of preventing h5 anymore.} Be8
31. Qd3 $2 {Not punishing black fully. Thanks to the d5 pawn the e7 knight
(black's elastic blockader), the b1-h7 diagonal doesn't have much promise for
the white queen. 31. Nhg4! once again would be indicated. The text gives black
some hope for counterplay by locking up the pawns and attacking the praised
passed e-pawn with 31. Rf6!. This would've been a sure win for white.} Qd6 {
31. Rf6! is a much stronger way to attack the e-pawn while protecting the
h-pawn. Also possible here would be locking up the pawns with 31. c4!.} 32. Qa6
$6 {Having to make the last few moves with about 30 seconds each, Tim picked
the less accurate of his three logical choices here. The important strategy
here is the use of the a1-h8 diagonal and that's done by exchanging. 32. dxc5!
was a fine move. Any other moves allow 32. c4! Locking up the pawn structure
and making use of the a1-h8 diagonal a thing of the past.} c4 $1 33. b3 c3 {
Of course not 33. Qxe6 because of 34. Nxc4!.} 34. Qd3 {
34. Nhg4 is the strongest in the position.} Qb4 35. Nhg4 $1 {This is still a
strong move, but it's effect has diminished over the past few moves. Stronger
yet would seem to be 35. Nd7!} Kg7 36. Nd7 Rh8 $6 {After the game, Tim pointed
out to me here a much stronger defensive opportunity. 36. Bg6! Prevents any
penetration by the queen and after 37. Qa6, then 37. Rfd8 and black's still
pretty solid.} 37. Qa6 $1 {Even better might be 37. Qe2! Qxd4 38. Ngf6 c2 39.
Rxc2 and White has an excellent game.} Rc6 38. Qa7 $2 {Here, white made haste
quickly, answering with 38. Qa7 after 30 seconds of thought. This isn't a bad
move at all, but much stronger in the position is the move 38. Nge5!.} c2 $4 {
Not punishing White in the least. Far superior is 38. Qd6! With pressure on
White's passed e-pawn. Now white has a won game.} 39. Ndf6 $1 {Nothing short
of beautiful. A discovered attack (and pin) on the defensive horse at e7 and
new pressure on black's bishop at e8. Tim's always quick to see strong tactics.
} Qd6 40. Nxd5 $3 {Pretty. Utilizing the overworked queen and adding another
attacker to the pinned knight.} Kf8 {Forced. Anything else loses terribly.
This move releases the pin and protects the knight once more.} 41. Nxe7 {
This is a fine move. I thought it was the best in the position until Tim
pointed out in post-game analysis 41. Re5!! This move is a very beautiful move
that rips the game open tactically all over the place.} Qxe7 42. Qb8 {
Intending 43. Qe5 with centralization.} Kg7 $4 {Time pressure caused the
game-losing blunder. Begging white to play what he had originally intended to
win material. Better was 42. Qd6.} 43. Qe5+ $1 Kg8 $2 {
Still losing, but better, is 43. Kh7.} 44. Nf6+ $1 Kf8 {
Still losing, but better again, is 44. Qxf6.} 45. Nxe8 $1 {
Another discovered attack. He's unleashing them one after the other.} Rg8 46.
Qf5+ {Even better is 46. d5!, though white is still winning undoubtedly.} Kxe8
47. Qb5 Qd6 {47. Kf8 was better than the text.} 48. d5 $6 {The more direct win
was 48. Rxc2!!. The rest of the game is self explanatory. In a few cases, Tim
didn't take the most efficient way to win or utilize the quickest checkmate
possibilities, but he was going at about 25 sec. on average per move towards
the end.} Ke7 49. Qxc6 Qxc6 50. dxc6 Rc8 51. Rxc2 Rc7 52. a3 h5 53. Re5 g4 54.

{00043.6.07 Analyzed by Expert Tim Smith} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. Bc4 {This is th
e Philidor Defense with some unusual lines. 3. Bc4 is perfectly all right, but
3. d4! offers much more possibilities. This is an opening where white can get
a big advantage in the center if black's not careful. The first way to get an
advantage was to play 3. d4. Again 3. Bc4 is playable.} Bg4 $6 {Not the best
choice in opening lines. It brings the queen's bishop out much too early. The
simple 3. Be7 or 3. Nc6 would've sufficed. Also, the strong 3. c6! is a great
way to take advantage of the fact that white didn't play d4 by intending d5
himself with a strong mobile center.} 4. h3 $6 {Some masters of the past have
tried this, but with not much success. This pin is not very strong at all.
There's no need to immediately tickle it with h3. Still attempting to build up
your center by 4. c3 and then d4 was a more preferable choice. Also, played
here has been 4. Nc3 with pressure on d5.} Bxf3 $2 {A mistake. The bishop
should've backed up to h5. Now white will get a strong opportunity to attack
the weak f7 point.} 5. Qxf3 Nf6 $2 {Definitely bad. Much better is 5. Qd7!
When the weak b-pawn can be defended by c6.} 6. d3 $6 {You have sound
development, but you're not being aggressive enough! 6. Qb3! Continued the
strong attack (very similar to Morphy - Duke of Brunswick in the Philidor's
Defense) and punished black for the mistakes of early development of the
queen's bishop and poor motive for exchanging the bishop.} g6 $2 {Bad, once aga
in, due to the fact it leaves the knight poorly protected (in the short term)
and the bishop has nothing to contribute to the game from that closed diagonal
(long term) unless a center break would occur. Better was mending the wounds
with 6. Nc6 or, in fact the aggressive 6. c6 once again, intending d5 when the
situation permits or queenside expansion with b5.} 7. Bg5 $1 {
Development with tempo. Nice.} Bg7 8. Bxf6 $6 Bxf6 {
Why exchange when your bishops are excellent?} 9. Nd2 {This move is good
development. It leaves open the option of playing c3. The other plan would
involve the d5 square with 9. Nc3.} O-O {You don't want to commit your king
until the center is defined and you have no weaknesses (g6 is your weakness
here). 9. Nd7 or 9. c6 immediately would be indicated. Now the powerful attack
on the h-file and a castle queenside can occur. Good strategy would involve
confusing your opponent so he doesn't find the correct strategy right away.}
10. O-O-O {Not bad at all! Slightly better still would be getting the h-pawn
rolling immediately with 10. h4!. 10. c3 could still successfully be played
now to intend a center break.} Nd7 {A decent developing move. However, an
attack on the wing can't beat a counterattack in the center. 10. Nd7 isn't the
most forcing. Better is 10. c6 once again leaving open b5 or d5 if it's
allowed.} 11. h4 $1 {This begins to attack the g6 weakness and attempts to
open the h-file. I'm impressed that each side saw the tactics involved in a
casual yahoo game. Of course, now not 11. Bxh4?, then 12. Qh3! (with an x-ray
attack on h7) c6 13. Qxh4 Qxh4 14. Qxh4 and a decisive material advantage with
still some hope for attack on the h-file.} Bg7 {Required is a central
counterattack with 11. c6, there might follow 12. h5 g5 13. Kb1 b5 14. Bb3 Nc5
and white has his own problems.} 12. h5 h6 $2 13. hxg6 $1 {Very nice. The
opening of the h-file is deadly, while the f7 pawn is being massacared.} Nf6 $2
{Other moves also lose. 13. Qf6 14. Bxf7+! Kh8 15. Qh3 Rfd8 16. Qe3 and
white's obviously winning. If 13. Qe7, then 14. Bxf7+! Rxf7 15. gxf7+ Qxf7 16.
Qg3 and white's winning.} 14. Rh2 $6 {Here you missed 14. Bxf7+ with a won
game. However, you still have a strong kingside pressure.} d5 {Good defense!
Counterattacking in the center is the way to refute a wing attack.} 15. exd5 $6
{Here you missed the intermezzo check with 15. gxf7+! Which opens the crucial
diagonal to the black king. After 15. gxf7+, then 15. Rxf7 16. exd5 Qd6 17.
Qg3! (threatening Rxh6) and you have a winning initiative.} fxg6 16. d6+ {
16. Qg3 was preferable and much more threatening, followed by 16. Kh7 17. Rdh1
Nxd5 18. Ne4 with threats of Ng5+ hanging in the air. This position would be
very uncomfortable for Black.} Kh8 17. Rdh1 {
In this position also, 17. Qg3 would make Black pay the piper quicker.} cxd6
18. Qxb7 d5 $4 {This loses outright. Much, much better where black is still in
the game is 18. h5. Now White can play the strong rook sacrifice 19. Rxh6+ Kg8
(if Bxh6 it's mate in a couple) 20. Rxg6 Rf7 (the only move) 21. Rh8+! Kxh8 22.
Qxf7 Qg8 23. Rxf6 and white has an easily won game.} 19. Bb5 $2 {Definitely a
blunder. The rook sacrifice wins more than a piece for nothing. This gives
black real counter chances. For instance 19. Ng4! which snatches back the
initiative and protects all of white's threats or the text.} Rb8 20. Qa6 $2 {
Once again, 20. Rxh6+ would seem to be in order. Now black has the advantage.}
Rb6 $6 {Black doesn't capitalize immediately which he could've done with 20.
Ng4! followed by 21. Qg5 with advantage.} 21. Qa4 Ng4 $4 {
Of course, this just loses a piece now that the white queen is on a4.} 22. Qxg4
Rxb5 $4 {21. Ng4 DID lose a full piece. The reason is because 22. Rxb5 leads
to a forced mate! Definitely required here was 22. Rxf2 and black is still
barely hanging on, though a piece down. White can force a checkmate with 23.
Rxh6+! Kg8 24. Qxg6 Qh4 25. R1xh4 Rxf2 (there's nothing else) and 26. Rh8
Checkmate.} 23. c4 $4 {A grave error, not winning the game at the earliest
moment. In fact, this once again gives Black counterchances.} dxc4 $4 {

{00045.6.09 Analyzed by Master Daniel Waite} 1. Nf3 f6 {This is a major
opening error. This pawn move does not aid in development and blocks the best
King Knight move. It does not develop a piece. It does not control central
squares (1/\f5 for instance does). It creates weakness on the Kingside.} 2. Nc3
c6 3. d4 d5 4. Bf4 {Interesting and "correct." Unfortunately "correct" in
chess is not always the "best." When an opponent is cobbled up like this
ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK! Here 4.e4 leads to a significant advantage due to
White's central control and Black's lack of development. h2-h3 "Lasker's rule"
states: "Always distrust a pawn move." The reason is that all pawn moves
change the game, forever. You can move any piece back and forth, but when a
pawn moves it can't go back. Thus you see the permanent nature of the pawn
move. Many players in your class tend to be afraid of "shadow" threats (/\Bg5).
Silman's rule is "if you see a threat, look for a way to ignore it." Lasker
urged, "defend with as little effort as possible." Typically this pin is an
illusion, especially before a person castles. It's only real purpose is to
control the dark squares on the Kingside (and possibly the center). a2-a3
Having protected the Kingside, you now seal off the Queenside. While this
seems prudent you must remember a simple idea. Now repeat after me, "always
play in the center." Remind yourself that if you do not play in the center you
will spend eternity attempting to win the E class at your local tournament. It
is a simple concept, but it is amazing how few of us catch on to it. Only play
on the side if there is a GM approved reason. f4-d2 Not bad but it is a waste
of a good move. Why did you put your bishop on f4 to begin with? To control
the middle? To control the Queenside? Well, then what is it doing on d2? You
have just wasted a good wish (to get to move twice in a game - here was that
extra move you wanted). If you were to play Bg3/h2 then you could still do the
control thing. e2-e3} c5 {Count the pawn moves your opponent has made so far.
Because the game remains closed Black survives 60 moves longer than he should
have. When you see this many pointless moves from your opponent, show no mercy.
Go after him, sacrifice material to open lines if you have to. These are easy
points! f1-b5+ c8-d7 b5xa6 Interesting choice. I like it. It creates some
interesting possibilities on the Queenside.} 5. dxc5 {f8xc5 b2-b4 Fingers off
the wing pawns! d1-e2 Again missing the chance to crack the game open with 13.
e4 c3xb5 a6xb5 e2xb5+ Good exchange idea! f3-d4} a6 $2 {b5xd7+ I'm not a fan.
Typically when you are up the idea is to avoid exchanges in favor of building
pressure. Then there is the idea that once a material advantage is obtained
trade into oblivion. It takes experience to know which to employ and when. The
key to this is to know how to win an endgame. When you can go into a "won"
endgame, but all means go for it! The fewer pieces in the middle game the
easier the defense - typically. This move shows lack of confidence. If you
lose make sure it is not due to lack of courage (Tal, if I remember correctly.)
O-O  Allowing Black to equalize immediately. Black has all sorts of weaknesses
and while you can castle you do not have to castle! I know we preach that you
should castle as soon as possible but that is only part of the idea. The
complete context is to castle as soon as safely possible with a reason. In
other words, play with the end in mind. Play with a plan. What does the
position demand? 18.Bc3! attacks Black's confused Kingside. g8-e7 a1-e1 e6-e5
d4-f3 e7-f5? Black gives up the initiative. /\Rac8 is the move. e3-e4 d5xe4
e1xe4 h8-e8? Giving White more targets than can be possibly covered. c2-c4
Another good idea is 23. g4. c4-c5 Excellent. I like how Silman encourages,
"when you see a threat, look for a way to ignore it!" Now you have the luxury
of ignoring further threats. d2-c3 b5 gives White two passed pawns and serious
attacking potential on the Queenside. For instance Bd1 then B anywhere/\.
f1-d1+ d7-c6 c3xb4 a8-d8 d1xd8 Rxd8 gives up the d-file. 28.Ree1 is best.
g2-g4 f5-h4 f3xh4 g5xh4 a3-a4 d8-b8 a4-a5 b8-d8 a5-a6 Sure is fun when all
your opponent can do is move back and forth! But I like getting the Rook
behind the pawns or invading with the King. c7-b8 b4-a5 Ba3! d8-d1+ g1-g2
d1-a1 e4-b4 b8-a7 b4-b7 a7xc5 b7-c7+ c6-b5 c7-b7+ Attacking when the position
does not justify an attack. This actually loses a piece to /\Kd6. Either way,
by attacking without positional justification you allow a winning advantage to
vaporize. a5-c3 a1-a3 c3-b2 a3-a2 /\Kxb7 42.Bxa3 Bxa3 wins a piece. b7-b8

g3xf3+ h4-g4 f3-g3+ g4-f4 g3xg7 f4-f3 g7-f7+ f3-e4 e3-e2 Coaches Advice: Your
road to chess improvement is through Karpov and his type. You must become
addicted to "positional" chess. You attacked when you should not have, you
traded when you should not have, and you castled when you had a much better
move. Study Silman's "How to Reassess your Chess" (easily the most useful book
on chess in the last 200 years), "The Amateur's Mind," and "How to/ \ Workbook.
" In a sense, I'm asking you to go back to "square one" and relearn the game.
The idea is to teach you to play with a plan. It is said that a "bad" plan is
better than no plan. When I say plan, it's not a legalism that controls every
thought. But there are some basic ideas like knowing when to attack and when
to defend that are critical. The cool part about this is once you have the
positional ideas down, you can attack like a mad dog when the position calls
for it. If you don't know then you will not pull off the brilliant attacks
when they are available. One piece of advice that will add 200 points to your
playing strength right now. ALWAYS (unless there is a specific GM approved
reason) PLAY IN THE CENTER! If you lose the center, you lose the game. The
center controls the game. The center is your brain, you lose your brain/\. OK
you get the picture. You will be surprised when you get this one concept down
with a passion that you will be able to play with anybody. (Or at least you
will get that feeling.) You will also be alegitimate threat to anyone (just
don't look at the rating, it messes with your mind). While you are doing this,
consider what openings you do well when playing. While 1.Nf3 is a very good
opening you must understand the ideas behind what you are attempting to
accomplish with it. Many players are looking for a win in the first 10 moves.
If this is you then 1.Nf3 is not our opening. If you are real good at endgames
then your best route is probably 1.e4 (assuming you can live through the
typically violent middle games). If you like positional chess then head for
the closed games you find in 1.Nf3, 1.c4, 1.d4. 1.f4. If you really like odd
ideas stick to 1.c4 (English) and 1.f4 (Bird) but I wouldn't stray beyond
those (possibly 1.Nc3 the Dunst is playable.) The reason for this advice is
that many players like an opening, for whatever reason, and do poorly in it
(typically because they 1. Do not understand it. 2. Do not feel comfortable in
the game. 3. Are not capable of grasping the concepts). For instance, I
attempted to play the Modern Benoni and was constantly beaten. My problem is
that I did not have the maturity in the areas that were necessary to play the
opening. Nothing personal, but the Benoni lived up to its name (son of my
sorrow). Meanwhile they rule with an opening that they, for whatever reason,
do not like. I used to play the English but abandoned it for more popular
openings. A while back I did an inventory and discovered that I did well in
English type positions and won 80% of my games. So when I'm in an important
game that I want to win, what opening do I play? (Hint: It's not 1.e4!) e4-d3}

at this point.} 6. dxc5 Bxc5 {Natural. You might consider the placement of the

proverbial idea of taking away the Knight's advance points but in this case it
opens the door for White to gain a comfortable position. When you have
positional justification - ATTACK! The move /\g6 can be played later. The idea
is to inspire those Queenside pawns to move and weaken themselves before your
opponent can fix the a-pawn and pick it off. Rad1 O.K. Your GM returns the
favor. 25. Rae1 grabs space and almost wins the endgame by force. You might
benefit by the study of isolated pawn play. The isolated pawn is safely
blocked. Controlling the e-file would cut off the support of the King. The
fatal attack on the blocked pawn must come either from behind or beside the
pawn. This can't be achieved with the Rook on d1. It's unbelievable that a GM
would miss this move. You get time to set up an adequate defense. Nice! This
is about the only chance you have to protect your weakness. White should now
shift the attention to immobilizing the a-pawn and finding a way to pile up

Rooks. Thus White's response is "forced." Rfe1 Rde7} Re7 {Rxe7} 25. f3 Nf6 {
28/\Ne3 is probably your last chance to win. However, it's not likely that an

strategy of simplifying into an end game will be your best chance of improving
your rating. Consider "instant" endgame openings - assuming you have the
patience to learn endgames really well. Nunn's book on Rook & Pawn endgames
and Silman's Endgames are basic reading. BTW, against a stronger opponent, I'm
always looking for a way to simply into a winning (or equal) endgame. It may
be a "boring" way to play but I've collected many scalps.} Nb6 *

generally not good to surrender the center. Much more aggressive and to the

your king bishop and retaining the extra pawn. Notice this will prevent
black's king bishop from taking control of that powerful diagonal that you
tried to get him off later in the game. After Bxc5, you played correctly by e3,

claims the black central squares as his with 4. d4. He intends maximum piece
deployment and speedy development, while gaining space. Arguably, it's the
best move on the board. 4...Nf6 a move earlier, declining the gambit, was
probably a stronger opening line theoretically as opposed to the accepting of
the gambit. Typically the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it as you
did, but not if you can gain so much time, development and static advantages
in pawn structure that you can create a won game before the opening ends.
Observe: After 3. Nf6, a line might be 4. bxc5 Nxe4 5. cxd6 Nc6 6. Bd3
(required in order to keep black's advantage in time less felt and because the
queen's bishop can come out actively on b2, not requiring the movement of the
d-pawn) Nf6 7. Nc3 e5 8. d7+ Bxd7 9. 0-0 Bd6, and you have an advantage in
time (2 tempi as black!) with open lines, attacking chances, and an advantage
in pawn structure. A master would typically consider those advantages
unrealistic with perfect play by white, but it's very achievable after 3...Nf6
in this opening variation which is a main reason this line hasn't been
analyzed in depth over the years. But, since you accepted the gambit on move 3,
4. Nf6 was a logical and required move. I question your idea at move 5, not
just the specific move you made. It's not a bad idea certainly. A fianchettoed
bishop is needed in the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian to coordinate a
queenside attack, but in this precise position, due to all the open lines not
usually there as well as a pawn you're now trying to hold on to, 5. e6 would
seem more logical setting up a Scheveningen-type formation, the purpose being
mainly to allow the queen's knight to come out without being harassed, which
otherwise would occur by Bb5 and d5. Observe the resulting position after you
play 5. e6 with the following line: 6. Bd3 Be7 7. 0-0 0-0 8. Qe2 Nc6 9. Bb2
(mainly threatening 10. d5 with the unleashing of a dangerous bishop harping
on the king) d5 in which you're successfully defending your b4 pawn remaining
a pawn ahead, while now possessing the c4 outpost on your half-open c-file. 6.
Bb2 was the first positional blunder by white. White should've put the
question to the limiting pawn by Rb1 and an eventual a3 because it's not easy
to defend it after your faulty 5th move. Another reason it's important to
eliminate that annoying b-pawn is to allow him to advance to c4 increasing his
spatial plus. The text is a move without specific purpose. It's unclear yet
where the queen's bishop should reside. Also, later in the game in order to
activate that bishop, it requires giving up control of e5 with a pawn as well
as loses time by not attacking with the advance.} 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Qc1 $2 Bd7 $2
9. d5 e6 10. Bc4 exd5 $1 {7. Bd3 is a typical developing move adding pressure
on the center. It isn't the best one, however. In this position, e2 is a much
better post for the bishop. The advantage at e2 is one of avoiding the cramp
that d3 entails and the supporting eventual kingside expansion via h4-5
destroying black's fianchettoed position. 8. Qc1 was an extremely questionable
move by your brother. It doesn't seem to have any active plan associated with
it at all according to his next moves. I'm not sure whether he played it to
unpin a possibly pinned knight at f3, to push the c-pawn (a good plan, but a
bad first move to carry it out), or to clear d1 for a different piece.
Whatever his initial thought was with that move, if he had any, he didn't
follow up. Much better is a3 or castling immediately, which continue to
undergo a plan. Observe the resulting position after this line: 8. a3 bxa3 9.
Rxa3 Nc6 10. 0-0 Nb4 11. Be2. Things look about as decent as they can with
white after his previous play. 8. Bd7 was your first major strategically
related mistake. D7 is the worst square for the queen's bishop. This is a
passive and hindering move as opposed to 8. Nd7 the ideal move for the
situation. Even 8. Bg4 had its own merit. The reason 8. Nd7 would be preferred
is because it allows for the excellent queenside play including the moves: a6,
b5, Bb7, Qc7, Rc8, Nb6 following with Nc4 supported by the b-pawn and heavy
pieces on the c-file. Another major plus of having the heavy pieces on the
c-file is the pressuring of white's backward c-pawn. Bd7 hindered the plan the
board wanted you to play. 9. d5 was a poor choice of move by white. First off,
he wrongly developed his bishop to b2 earlier in the game making it a handicap
that he's trying to get rid of now, secondly, he's wasting time trying to
activate it, lastly he gave up control of the important e5 square with a pawn.
Much better was the obvious 9. 0-0. It's good that you played by principle
(opening up the position when your opponent hasn't castled), but it leads to a
dead end since he can castle with one move at any time. Better was Na6 trying
to get your rooks into play and protecting your pawn that you're trying to
hold onto. Instead of moving a piece twice in the opening by 10. Bc4, white
should've taken his "reasonable" opportunity to castle!} 11. exd5 $2 Re8+ $1
12. Kf1 b5 13. Bd3 Nxd5 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 {11. exd5 was a poor move. 10. Bc4
would've been a tiny bit more reasonable if he would've captured d5 with it.
After 11. exd5 white's game starts to go downhill. 11. Re8+ is making powerful
use of the e-file to white's demise. Still better than 12. b5 is 12. Na6
getting the rest of your forces into the battle. Again, instead of 13. Nxd5,
13. Na6 was once again indicated. The "material advantage" after what you
played was only illusory and it also allowed white to swap black-squared
bishops weakening your king.} 15. Qb2+ Kg8 16. Be4 Bc6 17. Bxd5 Bxd5 18. Qxb4
Qf6 {15. Qf6 was preferable to the text. Preferable to 18. Qxb4 was a3 still
winning the pawn, however also un-isolating the a and c pawns.} 19. Re1 Rxe1+
20. Nxe1 a6 21. h4 Nc6 22. Qg4 h5 23. Qh3 Bxa2 {Much better than 19. Re1 was
Qd4, because it attempts to trade heavy pieces and gain the initiative after
white retakes with the knight because it compels black to do something about
the hanging pawn. Instead of 21. h4, your brother should've looked to the
other wing of the board and played a4 attempting to isolate your a-pawn after
the trade. Better than 22. h5 was Qa1 taking advantage of him not retreating
the Queen to b1 on his 22nd move. 23. Qh3 was an incorrect retreat. You
shouldn't back you queen into the edge. She needs to be centralized. 23. Qe2
was indicated, taking control of the open e-file and preventing black's rook
from doing the same. In response, 23. Re8 (remember, chess is a team game!)
was better than 23. Bxa2.} 24. Qf3 Qxf3 25. Ndxf3 Re8 26. g4 $4 {24. Qa3 was
better than the text because it's generally a poor idea to trade pieces being
down in material. 25. Re8 wasn't as forcing as the immediate Bc4+. You were
probably setting up the trap that white fell into, but you should play the
most forcing moves. 26. g4 was the game-losing blunder. White went two more
pawns down and could never recover. In case anyone was wondering, the line to
win the extra material would be: 26. Bc4+ 27. Kg2 hxg4 28. Nh2 Bd5+ 29. f3
gxf3+ 30. Nhxf3 Nd4 31. Kg3 Rxe1 32. Rxe1 Bxf3 and white loses two more pawns.
You both played very decently against one another for not playing each other
in 30 years. Some tips to remember are not to blindly gain material when you
can gain plenty of time and development, develop a piece one time in the
opening to the best square (remember Bd7?), and try to work with your
strategical game a little bit. Good overall game.} Bc4+ $1 *

4. Bb5 Na5 {This is a error. There are several reasons for this judgment.
First, the Knight and the Bishop are of equal value. Your Bishop move does not
really immediately threaten anything. Finally, the Knight on the rim is
severely restricted in its movement. As you get better you will find
exceptions to the rule for concrete reasons. But for now remember, "a Knight
on the rim is dim."} 5. Nxe5 {
Good! You removed the defender and now you pick up the piece.} Bd6 {This is not
a good place for the Bishop because it blocks the advance of the d-pawn. If
the d-pawn is blocked then the Queen Bishop will have difficulty developing

Black heads for a Slav/Orthodox complex.} 7. Bxc4 Bb4 {This move makes sense
but the Bishop does not belong here in this set up. The Bishop will go to d6
and the Queen Knight will plant itself on d7. The Queen Rook will go to c8 and
then Black will hammer the White center with c5. The traditional idea is to
get the Rook to c2 and then stack the heavy pieces on the c - file. This tends
to be a very effective strategy for Black. In essence Black wastes a move.
This is a common problem for computers. The machine generally calculates
without a long term plan.} 8. O-O O-O 9. Bd2 Nbd7 10. Ne2 Bd6 {Black is beginni
ng to put the pieces where they belong. White must now generate some offense.
Typically White will want to do one of two things. White will want to launch a
"minority" Queen side attack using the two pawns supported by pieces against
the three Black pawns. The other idea is to simply play in the middle. If we
do a "point count" on the central squares we get this: For White, on d5 = 1
point, on e5 = 2 points, on d4 = 3 points, on e4 = zero points. Total = 6
points for White on central control. For Black, d5 is attacked/controlled 3
times, e5 gains 2 points, d4 is good for zip, while e4 nets two more points.
Total for Black would be 7 points. Thus Black has a slight edge in the center.}
11. Ng3 Bg6 12. Nh4 {While nothing is objectively wrong with this move, I'd
like to see something aggressive from my students. Personally 12.b4 and the
beginning of the "minority" attack looks appealing.} Be4 13. Nxe4 Nxe4 14. Nf3
c5 {This is known as a "lever." The threatened exchange forms an advantage at
that spot for the one who created it. Meanwhile the one who liquidates it
generally is at the disadvantage. Thus, Black will want to create as much
pressure on d4 and the c - file before liquidating the lever. This is one of
the "subtleties" of pawn play. Another way to do this with advantage would be
to play 14...Rc8 first. For instance, 14...Rc8 15.Qc2 Nxd2 16.Nxd2 c5 17.Ne4

Bxc2 Rd8. And Black pulls off a small advantage due to better central control
and active pieces.} 15. Bc3 Nxc3 {Interesting contradiction in chess ideas.
Technically White has managed to exchange off the "bad" Bishop, almost
unforced. Yet if it had been allowed to exist on c3 then Black might have been
faced with a very dangerous threat down the a1 - h8 diagonal. Black's choice
is a practical one but it has an ugly down side. Assuming that Black makes the
trade of pawns at d4, to open the c-file, then White will have two central
pawns to Black's one. This should help White to control the center in the long
haul.} 16. bxc3 Nb6 17. Bd3 cxd4 18. cxd4 Qe7 19. Qc2 f5 $6 {Creating a long
term weakness. There is a "hole" at e5 and a "backward" pawn on e6. White
should try to immobilize the pawn on e6 then "stack the attack" (a.k.a. the
"HackStack Attack" for younger players) on e6.} 20. e4 {White completely
misses the opportunity. Not only is this not good, it's close to a blunder.
One of the problems with the move, other than missing a golden winning idea,
is that it gives a center pawn away for a less valuable f - pawn. The other
problem is that it flips the weak pawn possibilities if White exchanges on f5.
You must have been looking at a concrete tactical idea at this point. However,

and does the only sensible thing. Nice job. Prescription for improvement:
First, your Endgame play is weak. As you get stronger (and your opponents get
stronger) this will become a critical component of your game. Also it is a way
to clip stronger players, if you can get to a superior Endgame. Most players
focus on the Opening and Middlegame but if you get to the Endgame, you'll
acquire a nice collection of scalps. Second, either switch to playing 1. e4
(good idea if you are under 1500) or burn the midnight oil on the positional
aspect of the game. This game was positional, and you did well for the most
part. If you can major on this and become the most boring chessnut in your
neck of the woods, people will fear playing you. Once you get the positional
ideas down, then you can work on the tactical. Generally the tactical aspect
of the game is easier because it involves learning patterns and does not take
much planning. It is one thing to capitalize on an opponent's mistake, it is
another (much more satisfying event) to create the mistake that leads to the
wonder combination. If this doesn't appeal to you watch a cat the next time it
hunts. The cat doesn't mind the time it takes to stalk its prey. Nor does it
have any scruples about playing with its helpless opponent before turning it
into food. Just remember it's a game. When the cat's target gets away, it just
stretches and looks for a shady spot for a nap. "Go thou and do likewise."
Finally, take the batteries out of the computer and use it to hold something
down. They are fun to play now and then but they will not help your game. In
fact they will probably train you in some very bad habits. With the
availability of the Internet there is someone available somewhere at all times
to play.} 56. f6 *

your resources, but black could have had a large advantage, mainly due to your
allowing him to post a knight on d5 uncontested. Avoid doing this if at all
possible, and try to exchange/boot away your opponent's well placed pieces.} *

alert to tactical possibilities.} 9. d4 Be6 {Qd1 Rfd8 Passing on the creation
of the isolated d-pawn (/\cxd4) is good here. It shows mature thought, even if
it was not intentional. We all learn to automatically filter some things by
instinct. This is a time saver but must be deliberately challenged. In this
filtering process we develop bias such as (+)labels.[+] (e.g. ethnic and
religious affiliations) These tend to put blinders on us. In chess, the basic
teacher develops a set of rules and presents them in lessons. This system of
indoctrinating the student is good because they must be understood since
violating them means terrible consequences. Having come to understand the
basic filters and biases we then learn to develop (+)exceptions[+] and deeper
understandings. It is the difference between following the Law and living by
the Spirit. One such 'law' in chess is that the isolated pawn is a (+)bad[+]
thing. Typically, if you know how to handle the position, the isolated pawn
can be difficult from either perspective. The fact that you either
intentionally passed on this idea or unintentionally filtered the idea shows
good potential. If it was an unintentional filter then you must focus energy
on questioning these filters.} 10. e3 Bd5 11. Qe2 b5 {Rfd1 Bc4} 12. Qc2 Qb6 13.

Taking the pawn with /\Nxa2 should have given you the game. At least this move
does not lose.} 16. h4 h6 17. Nf3 {Nd5 This is your (+)losing move.[+] There
is a fine line between a (+)great[+] player and a (+)good[+] player. Several
distinguishing characteristics are important to note at this point. For
instance the (+)great[+] player has in reserve a larger number of recognized
positions (and the tricks that go with them). A (+)great[+] player also has
the sense of when the position is critical. This is such a moment. Normally,
I'd rail on this move but you had the courage to send in the game and learn
something useful. Getting back to the idea of material, I like taking at a2.
An interesting idea is /\Bd3. Once again, protecting the pawn is an illusion.
Notice 23/\Bxa2 23.Qxe7 Rb7 24.Qe4 f5 and once again the Queen gets to watch
from the side of the board. This Knight, in this position, loses effective
influence on the center. Ne5 Nf6 Qf4} Rc8 18. g4 Qe6 {Rd2 Nd7 L esson number
four: play with a plan! d5 Qf6 White chokes and gives Black the game (again)
but this follow up mistake to 22/\Nd5 returns the favor. White gains a Rook, a
Knight, a Bishop, and spare change for the Queen with 22/ \Qxe5. Remember the
(+)law[+] we talked about earlier? One of the lesson/laws we preach is (+)
protect the Queen at all costs.[+] The trouble is that it is more important to
protect the King! If you count material, you will find that Black gains
material on the exchange. Nc6} 19. Qf4 {Ne7  Kh7  ef4 Bb2 Rb2 Rc5 Nc6 Re8 Rd2

Coach's advice: For courage in allowing me to examine a lost game A+! This
shows a desire to actually correct faulty thinking processes. (If only I could
have your thoughts as you were thinking them/\..) So some ideas/\/\ Challenge
your filters. You seem to be unwilling to grab the pawn when it was available
but unwilling to give up the pawn for a greater good (winning the Queen).
Start paying attention to these filters and force yourself to look beyond
these (+)laws[+] you have learned. The truth is on the board, not on a set of
learned rules. You show good positional judgment but do not seem to have good
attacking skills. The problem with good positional judgment is that if you
focus here, it is not enough to win! Somewhere you must attack, even if it is
(+)pawn picking.[+] I'd suggest that you develop a (+)catalogue of positions.
[+] To do this get some cards or a notebook where you will record positions
for games you play or see. Somewhere keep a (+)key[+] on the correct moves by
category. Keep it as simple as possible. Maybe topics would include (+)
sacrifice[+], (+)pawns[+], (+)king safety.[+] Don't buy a book! You must do
the work yourself, if a position strikes you enough for you to take the time
to record it then you are more likely to learn it for yourself. I see that you
are a (+)club[+] player. Clubs are fun and often good chess but/\.. The
tendency is to play (+)cat and mouse[+] games with the other players minds.
I'd suggest that you settle into three systems (two with Black and one with
White) and play them regardless of who you play and what your opponent played
last time. Here is the trick. You opponents will prepare for you, since you
will be predictable, and will find the most difficult lines for you. That is
good, they will test you and force you to grow and develop good lines. It will
also force you to be precise in your opening moves. The idea is that you will
have three openings that you know as well as anyone in the world and can play
in any circumstance. Nb3} *

{00053.6.24 Analyzed by Candidate Master Daniel Waite} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3.
Bc4 h6 {This is a wasted move because the primary objective of the opening is
get your pieces to useful squares as soon as possible. Time can be a decisive,
depending on how you use it.} 4. c3 {The Giuoco Pianissimo. The idea is to
play a quiet controlled game. Unfortunately many underestimate the potential
of quiet moves and quiet games. This is fine if you understand the options and
what you are choosing. For instance 4.0-0 is strongest and 4.d4 is interesting.
Also playable is 4.Nc3 but this leads down some very sharp lines. I don't like
this move. It certainly develops a piece but it does not stop the intended 5.
d4. This gives White a target in the center, which means that time can be
gained by attacking the Bishop. d4 An interesting idea is 5.b4 but it is
generally wise to play in the center unless there is a specific reason. cxd4
Bb6 Again, Black does not help the cause in the center. /\Bb4+ is much
stronger and because it puts pressure on the White center (attacking a
supporting pieces with a pin). Also notice that the Bishop has moved twice and
is not necessarily useful at b6 in this position. b3 Fasinating idea. The
possibilities of playing Bb2 or Ba3 offer Black some potential headaches. I
personally like 7.0-0 because another primary idea of the opening is King
safety. Preparing to castle is one of those keys. Remember because you are
ready to castle does not mean you have to castle but all things being equal,
typically you will want to castle as soon as it is safely possible.} *

Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O {This is reasonable, but it is known that black gets a good
game in the Berlin Defense (which is ...Nf6 without ...a6 in the Ruy Lopez). I
prefer either 4. d3 or 4. Qe2, keeping the position closed, and preserving the
winning chances for white.} Nxe4 5. Re1 {If black plays properly should lead
to equality. Theory suggests 5. d4 as the best chance for an advantage.} Ng5 {
Dubious. Now white can try 6. Nxg5 Qxg5 7. d4 (notice this move causes the c1
bishop to hit the black queen) to try to fight for the initiative. Instead 5. .
.. Nd6 would give black equality with no problems. For example, 5. ... Nd6 6.
Bxc6 dxc6 (to open up the diagonally for the light-squared bishop) 7. Nxe5 Be7,
with a very reasonable game for black.} 6. Nxe5 Be7 7. c3 {Why not 7. d4
straight away? Normally in Ruy Lopez, c3 is needed to help get in the d4 push,
but not here. There was nothing preventing white from playing 7. d4 and 8. Nc3,
completing development.} Nxe5 8. Rxe5 c6 {Here the computer does a strong
multi-purpose move. ...c6 does the following: a) frees the black d-pawn to
move (it was pinned before) b) opens the a5-d8 diagonal for the black queen,
and c) helps establish a strong pawn center on d5.} 9. Ba4 O-O 10. d4 d5 11.
Bf4 {A natural move, but a little too mechanical. The bishop has good scope on
c1. White's best chance for an advantage is a king-side buildup. Here, I would
choose 11. Nbd2, with the idea of Nd2-f1-g3 and Bc2, and you can see a lot of
pressure on black's king-side.} Ne6 12. Bg3 Bd6 13. Re1 Bxg3 14. fxg3 {
Definitely a mistake. The general rule of thumb is: If you have more than one
pawn that can recapture take toward the center. In this case, that would be 14.
hxg3. The only time you don't follow this principle, is something VERY
specific is to be gained by not doing so. Here, this opens the f-line, but
that leads to nothing. Also, this loosens the g1-a7 diagonal. As we'll see
later in the game, black takes advantage of this fact.} Qb6 15. Bb3 Bd7 16. Nd2
{A natural move, but this sets up black's sacrifice of a piece for 2 pawns.
Notice that if your pawn was on f2, black would only get 2 pawns, because then
the recapture on d4 wouldn't be check, and you could defend your b-pawn.} Nxd4
17. cxd4 Qxd4+ 18. Kh1 Qxb2 {Sometimes 3 pawns are worth a pieces, sometimes
not. In this case, black gets connected, passed (passed pawn = pawn unopposed
by enemy pawns), and MOBILE center pawns, so it's worth it. If the black pawns
had no mobility (such as if they were blockaded), then it wouldn't be.} 19. Re7
Rad8 20. Nf3 {Instead of this, 20. Rb1 Qf6 21. Qe2 (notice the rook isn't
hanging in this line) ...Rfe8 22. Rae1 offers better chances of survival.} Qf6
21. Qe1 Rfe8 22. Rxe8+ Rxe8 23. Qd1 Bg4 24. Bc2 Re3 25. Rb1 b6 26. a4 {
This of course is a mistake. You need to hold onto your pawns. Rb3 would
defend your knight on f3 laterally.} Bxf3 27. gxf3 Rxf3 28. Kg1 Re3 29. Ra1 Re2
30. Kh1 {As ugly as it may look, 30. Qxe2 was the only way to play on. Black
would still be winning, but at least white is still "kicking".} Qf3+ 31. Kg1
