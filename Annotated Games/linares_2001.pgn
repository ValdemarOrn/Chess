albeit with a little help from his opponent, who made the cardinal error of
trapping her king on the backrank.  The only reason I remember this was I had
to do a review in a magazine of the ChessBase Endgame CD-Rom's containing all
five-piece major endings on 4-CDs, which had just come out at the time. I
still find them indispensible - particularly as coasters when friends come
round and I don't want stains on the coffee table!    However, with Shirov's
king so central, the only way he could lose it now was by a Helpmate.  Shirov

There was an interesting aside here.  After the game, Alexei Shirov one (if
not THE) world expert on this line, asked the hacks in the press room after
the game if Karpov hadn't seen Kasparov's own analysis to his game with Bareev
at KasparovChess.com, where Garry had mentioned the possibility of animpending 
disaster in this line for Black after 9 h4?  Good question, Alexei!  But I
replied that after Karpov's disastrous computer handling during his Advanced

the Internet was!  For the record, here's Shirov-Bareev game from New Delhi.}

{"Remember the name of Alexander Grischuk for the future - he's got great
potential," was the prophetic words to me last year at Linares from the
legendary Russian chess editor of "64 - Review", Alexander Roshal.    Much
like Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik, the 17-year-old
Muscovite is another Russian who's become the leading player of his generation
- and one with genuine designs on the laurel leafs of the world championship. 
   The last year has proved to be the big breakthrough for Grischuk as he
moved onto the world stage. After strong showings in the New York Open,
Reykjavik Open and North Sea Cup, he went on to big wins at the Lausanne Yong
Masters, Chigorin Memorial and the Torshavn International. Not content with
that, he more than played his part in Russia winning the recent Chess Olympiad
in Istanbul.     However, the highlight of that glittering year was
unquestionably his performance in the Fide KO world championship in New Delhi.
Unlucky to be knocked out in the semi-final by Alexei Shirov in a superb match,
Grischuk walked away with some serious pocket money -  $172,000!    Grischuk
showed he had a much better feeling for handling the nuances of the Black side
of the Lopez than Leko, as he came close to defeating Judit Polgar.  } 1. e4 e5
