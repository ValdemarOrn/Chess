1. e4 c5 { Gelfand plays openings which are ideal for an aggressive player, but he isn't a wild-eyed tactician; he's a planner and classical positional player. } 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 d6 ( 3...Qc7 ) ( 3...g6 ) 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O Bg4 ( 5...e5 { Kasparov-Polgar, Eurotel, 2002, 1-0 } ) 6. h3 Bh5 7. e5 { White's aim is to open the e-file or to "break" Black's pawn structure. The immediate threat of e5-e6 is reminiscent of an Alekhine's Defense position. If White doesn't play e4-e5 immediately then Black might get sufficient control of e5 to keep White boxed-in on the light squares. } 7...e6 { Black tries to keep control of e5 to prevent White from playing g2-g4 followed by Nf3-e5. } ( 7...d5 8. e6 fxe6 9. Re1 ) ( 7...dxe5 $5 8. g4 ( 8. Re1 $6 f6 ( 8...Qd5 $6 9. g4 Bg6 10. Rxe5 Qd6 ) ) 8...Bg6 9. Nxe5 Qd6 { and it's not clear who's weaknesses are most significant } ) 8. exd6 Bxd6 { While Black gets good piece activity the poor pawn structure must make Gelfand a little nervous. } 9. d3 ( 9. d4 cxd4 10. Qxd4 Bxf3 ( 10...Bh2+ $4 11. Kxh2 Bxf3 12. Qxg7 Qf6 13. Qxf6 Nxf6 14. gxf3 ) 11. Qxg7 Qf6 12. Qxf6 Nxf6 13. gxf3 Rg8+ 14. Kh1 Rb8 { and Black's terrific piece activity should give him the advantage. The immediate threat of ...Rb8-b5-h5xh3# should make White worry. } ) 9...Ne7 10. Nbd2 O-O { Playing a Nh4 or Nd4 to add pressure to the pin on Nf3 would be desirable, but White can step out of the pin with Qd1-e1. Black has to do more, so he castles and prepares to bring more forces into play. } ( 10...Nf5 { is a very uncertain sacrifice offer } 11. Qe1 ( 11. g4 Bg6 12. gxf5 Bxf5 13. Kg2 ) 11...O-O ( 11...Nd4 12. Nxd4 cxd4 13. Qe4 Rc8 { leaves Bh5 striking at thin air and Pd4 is a little weak } ) 12. g4 Bg6 13. gxf5 Bxf5 14. Kg2 ) 11. Ne4 { Though White needs to clear the way for Bc1 to develop it's a little odd to see him weaken Nf3 this way. Does he intend to move Bc1 and then play Ne4-d2 to re-establish the defense of Nf3, or is g2-g4 still being considered? } 11...Nd5 12. Re1 { White's pawn structure is quite modest, but from that his pieces might spring forward. Only the pin on Nf3 is troublesome. } 12...Re8 { It appears Black might want to play ...e6-e5 to secure control of d4 and f4, but he might also have in mind to play ...Bd6-f8 to keep the bishop on the board. } ( 12...Rb8 ) 13. Ng3 { So, this is the idea behind Nd2-e4. Black has to either retreat and give up on the pin on Nf3 or give up one of the bishops for a knight. He could trade off Bd6  (13...Bxg3 14. fxg3) or Bh5 (13...Bxf3 14. Qxf3) . } 13...Bg6 { Apparently he didn't see any immediate value to trading, so he keeps the two bishops in hopes of some future time when they'll be especially valuable. } 14. Ne4 Bc7 $2 { I don't understand giving up Pc5 in this situation. What plan does Black follow which demands the bishop be at c7 rather than d6 or f8? } ( 14...Bxe4 $6 15. dxe4 Nb6 16. e5 Bf8 17. Qe2 { and Black is cramped on the king-side by Pe5 and his queen-side is awkward } ) 15. Nxc5 e5 { Black threatens to open the position, possibly with ...f7-f5, ...e5-e4, before White can complete his development. } 16. a3 { White, apparently, is not terribly impressed and simply uses Pa3 to oppose Nd5 and possibly to support b2-b4, whereby Nc5 is defended and Bc1-b2 becomes available. } 16...f5 17. c4 { The resulting weakness at d4 seems trivial. The more important thing is to get rid of Nd5, so Bc1 can be developed to a useful square. } 17...Nf6 18. d4 $5 ( 18. Bg5 ) 18...e4 19. Ne5 ( 19. Nh4 Bh5 20. Qa4 Qd6 21. g3 { when Nh4 is a bit stranded, but Bh5 isn't necessarily very good and Pd4 is weak, but Pc6 is too. There are a lot of positional features which have to be comprehended before it can be said who is better or what their plans are. } ) 19...Bh5 ( 19...Bxe5 20. dxe5 Rxe5 { seems simple enough and a good choice for Black. White is simply giving back the pawn he'd won earlier, to ensure easy development and a queen-side pawn majority for the ending. } 21. b4 { secures Nc5 and prepares either Bc1-b2 or Bc1-f4 } ( { not bad, but perhaps not best is } 21. Be3 Bh5 22. Qa4 Qd6 23. b4 Ree8 { when Black threatens ...f5-f4 } ) 21...Bh5 22. Qa4 Qe8 23. Bf4 Re7 24. Bd6 Rf7 ) 20. Qd2 { just keeping Pd4 defended, however awkward it may be } 20...Qd6 { This clearly indicates he intends to get rid of Ne5 with his rook, hoping to retain control of f4 with Qd6 & Bc7. } 21. Qc3 Rad8 ( 21...Rxe5 $4 22. dxe5 Qxc5 23. exf6 ) 22. Be3 { Black has reached an impasse. His queen and rooks and even Bc7 are blocked severely on dark squares by Pd4 & Ne5. } 22...Rxe5 ( 22...f4 $4 23. Bxf4 Qxd4 24. Qxd4 Rxd4 25. Nxc6 ) 23. Nb7 { White keeps Pd4 and Be3 to maintain control of the central dark squares. } ( 23. dxe5 Qxe5 24. Qxe5 Bxe5 25. Rab1 f4 26. Bc1 { and Black has some advantages which compensate for the exchange sacrifice } 26...Bg6 ) 23...Qf8 24. dxe5 { White wins one exchange and now threatens two more! This looks like a catastrophe for Black. } ( 24. Nxd8 Re8 25. Nxc6 f4 ) 24...Rd3 { saving one exchange and gaining time to save the other } 25. Qb4 Bxe5 26. Qxf8+ Kxf8 { At this moment it appears Black has made the necessary breakthrough. Be5 is a powerhouse and Rd3 is also very good. } 27. Nc5 Rd6 28. Nb7 Rd7 29. Nc5 { White seems satisfied to repeat the position. Black may think he has the better of it, so he tries for more. I don't think that's a wise decision. } 29...Re7 30. Rab1 f4 31. Bd2 { This move is what Black allowed when he refused to repeat the position and played 29...Re7. White now threatens Nc5xe4. } 31...Bd6 ( 31...Bd4 32. Bb4 Kf7 33. Nb3 Rd7 34. Nxd4 Rxd4 35. Bc5 Rxc4 36. Bxa7 { and the fight goes on, but Black no longer has the advantage of the two bishops! } ) 32. b4 ( 32. Bb4 $4 a5 ) 32...Kf7 $6 ( { It might be too late for Black to turn back the tide, because of the earlier exchange sacrifice, but I think Black needs to advance some pawns for the purpose of creating contact with the enemy. This would cause White to pause in his queen-side advances. } 32...g5 33. Bc3 Be5 34. Nxe4 Nxe4 35. Bxe5 Rxe5 36. f3 Bg6 37. fxe4 Ke7 $16 ) 33. Bc3 e3 ( { Now it's too late for } 33...g5 $4 34.

1. e4 c6 { Bareev has been a French Defense player for a long time. This may be the first non-French Defense game I've seen him play. He's a classical positional player, as is Leko! } 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 ( 3. e5 ) 3...dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 { White immediately goes after the exposed Bg6. This has been a normal move for many years now. The main alternative is to first play 6. Nf3, threatening Nf3-e5xg6. } 6...h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 { Doing without h4-h5 has also been played quite a lot. Later on the Ph5 could be a weakness as it can quickly be threatened by ...Ng8-f6. } 8...Bh7 9. Bd3 { It always seems a little odd to see this bishop trade offer. Bd3 is White's better bishop, not conflicting with Pd4, but Bh7 is a very good piece and if Black puts all his pawns in the center on light squares then White's light-square bishop won't be better on any other square. } 9...Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 ( 10...Qc7 { prevents Bc1-f4 and prepares ...O-O-O. But, sometimes Black prefers to castle king-side, so he can advance on the queen-side. } ) 11. Bf4 Qa5+ 12. Bd2 Bb4 { This is an interesting move which I've only seen recently. It essentially forces a weakening of White's queen-side pawn structure. In times past Black used to play ...Qa5-c7 and possibly aim for a bishop trade by ...Bf8-d6-f4xd2. } 13. c3 Be7 { With Ph5 it's not so likely (though not impossible) for White to O-O, but with Qa5 it's not so easy for White to O-O-O. I think White would like to continue playing toward the center and see how Black's pieces develop before committing Ke1. But, Bd2 would be dominated too easily by a ...Nd5. The cautious alternative 14. a3, preparing c3-c4, just weakens White's queen-side further. } 14. c4 ( 14. Bf4 $2 Ngf6 15. Ne5 Nd5 16. Nxd7 ( 16. Bd2 Nxe5 17. dxe5 O-O-O ) 16...Nxf4 17. Qf3 Nxg2+ 18. Qxg2 Kxd7 19. Ne4 ) 14...Qa6 { By itself the position of Black's queen should be some kind of warning that his position isn't going to become sufficiently active. Qd3 isn't defended, so there is still some possibility for Black to break out of the shell, but it could quickly become very difficult. } ( 14...Bb4 $6 15. a3 Bxd2+ 16. Nxd2 { and oddly it's White who can play b2-b4 to begin a queen-side offensive and then O-O } ) 15. O-O Ngf6 { preparing ...c6-c5xd4. Earlier White could avoid the pawn trade with d4-d5. } 16. Rfe1 O-O ( 16...c5 $2 17. d5 exd5 18. Nf5 Ng8 19. Qxd5 ) 17. Nf5 { White can't yet afford Bd2-c3 because ...Nf6-d5 (Pc4 is pinned) threatens Bc3. } ( 17. Ne5 { aims to build pressure in the center, but without allowing any simplifying exchanges which would ease Black's cramp. Besides, there might be some other moment when Ng3-f5 could be played with greater effect. } ) 17...Rfe8 18. Nxe7+ Rxe7 19. Bb4 Ree8 20. Ne5 Rad8 ( 20...Nxe5 21. dxe5 Nxh5 22. Qe4 g6 { Black has some weak spots and Nh5 is awkward, but White doesn't yet have a winning attack. } ) 21. Qe2 ( { Too fanciful is the immediate sacrificial "attack". } 21. Nxf7 $4 Kxf7 22. Qg6+ Kg8 23. Re3 Qxc4 24. Rg3 Nxh5 25. Qxh5 Qxb4 ) 21...b5 { Black wants to break up White's pawns, so he can use d5. } ( 21...c5 ) 22. Rac1 ( 22. b3 ) 22...bxc4 ( 22...Qxa2 $2 23. Ra1 Qb3 24. Nxc6 Ra8 25. cxb5 ) 23. Qxc4 { White's pieces are much better and Pc6 is very weak. The only question is whether Black can apply equivalent pressure to Pd4. } 23...Qxc4 24. Rxc4 Nb6 25. Rxc6 Rxd4 26. Bc5 ( 26. Bc3 Ra4 ) 26...Ra4 { Black's position looks pretty good now. It's clear White wants to make something happen on the queen-side with his two-to-one pawn advantage and Black has to slow him down while making more of his king-side, mainly by grabbing Ph5. } 27. a3 { Ra4 could be very awkward, perhaps even trapped by White's bishop and pawns. } ( 27. Bxb6 axb6 28. a3 Rb8 ) 27...Nc4 $2 { This just begs for White to play b2-b3, forking Ra4 & Nc4. } ( 27...Rc8 28. Rxc8+ ( 28. Bxb6 Rxc6 29. Nxc6 axb6 30. Nb4 Ra5 ) 28...Nxc8 29. Bb4 Nd5 30.

This makes it much simpler for White to win Pa5 and the resulting endgame. } 42...Rxb1+ 43. Nxb1 a4 44. Na3 { This isn't the simplest ending to win. Pa4 restrains a minor piece and Pa4 isn't so easily gotten rid of. } 44...Nd5 45. Bb2 g5 46. Nc4 h5 ( 46...Kg6 47. g4 { keeps Black's king boxed-in } ) 47.

Ke2 Kh6 { Apparently Black is hoping to advance Ph5, particularly if White's king is too far afield, dealing with Pa4. } 50. Kd3 Nb4+ 51. Kc4 Nd5 52. Bc1 Nf6 { The threat to Pg5 by the long-range Bc1 has caused Black to retreat his knight all the way across the board. } 53. Kd3 ( 53. Nf7+ Kg6 54. Nxg5 Ng4 55. Nh3 ) 53...Nh7 54. Ke2 ( 54.

1. d4 g6 { From what I've seen Morozevich prefers stable pawn structures and depends upon piece play. He might like a Benko Gambit or a Dutch Defense, but in this case he's trying to provoke Bareev into 2. e4, an opening system Bareev doesn't usually play. This position could easily transpose to many different things: Dutch Leningrad with ...f7-f5, Gruenfeld with c2-c4 ...d7-d5, King's Indian Defense with c2-c4 ...Ng8-f6 and others. } 2. g3 { This is usually followed by c2-c4 to make a King's Indian Defense, Fianchetto Variation or, after ...d7-d5, a Gruenfeld Defense. } ( 2. e4 ) 2...Bg7 3. Bg2 ( 3. c4 ) 3...c5 { This forces the game off into another direction. It's thematic for Black to fight on the dark squares, but White's setup is a little unusual. If White plays d4-d5 Black might play ...b7-b5; something he wouldn't ordinarily be able to do. } 4. c3 { White chooses to support his central pawn and to block Bg7, but at the cost of not having c3 available for a knight. Incidentally, Pc5 is now threatened. } ( 4. dxc5 $5 Qa5+ 5. Bd2 Qxc5 6. Bc3 ) 4...Qa5 { Black thre atens ...cxd4 to remove the central pawn. For White to simply defend it with Ng1-f3 is possible, but ...cxd4 cannot be replied to with c3xd4 (it's pinned) , so the central pawn is removed. } 5. Nd2 $5 { White uses a small tactic to get rid of Qa5, so Pc3 can truly support Pd4. } 5...cxd4 6. Nb3 { Black's queen is chased off the a5-e1 diagonal! } 6...Qb6 7. cxd4 { O.K. White has the central pawn, but Nb3 isn't terribly well placed. Black could go after it with ...a7-a5-a4. } 7...Nf6 { Black chooses not to make it an issue immediately and develops more pieces. That's quite good because it's a recognition Black doesn't have to chase Nb3 and wouldn't necessarily gain anything from chasing Nb3 anyway; that Black can simply play normal moves and the weakness of Nb3 will show itself. } ( 7...a5 8. Nf3 a4 9. Nc5 Qb4+ ( 9...Qb5 ) ) 8. d5 $5 { Audacious moves such as this aren't seen often. Black has traded his central pawn away and White shoves his to cramp Black, preventing ...d7-d5 or ...Nb8-c6. Black has to act forcefully to be rid of the influence of Pd5 or create some way to play around it. } 8...d6 9. Nf3 ( 9.

Qd2 { White just keeps moving forward into the breech and Black can't easily challenge any of White'spieces! } 14...Rfc8 { Though Black's position is generally cramped it's well coordinated and each piece, except perhaps Qa6, has a safe square to sit on. For White to gain some advantage he has to change that and perhaps advance his queen-side pawns or make some gesture toward the king-side (Kg8) . } ( 14...Nfe4 $2 15.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 { Though he has occasionally played this before it's somewhat interesting because usually plays 2...Nc6, often heading for the Marshall Gambit of the Spanish Game. } 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Nc6 7. O-O Be7 8. c4 Nf6 { Essentially Black says White will have an isolated queen's pawn and Black will develop easily and then attempt to exploit his pawn structure advantages  (White's disadvantages) . } ( 8...Nb4 { is the other common move } ) 9. h3 { White is anticipating having an isolated queen's pawn and wants to avoid ...Bc8-g4xf3, undermining Pd4. } ( { Interesting is } 9. c5 { to preserve his pawn strucure and to "punish" Black for not opening the position } 9...Bg4 10.

Be2 dxc4 { Finally Black feels it's safe, or necessary, to get rid of Pc4. } 12. Bxc4 c6 { After this it's clear Black's plan is to occupy square d5, trade off White's light square bishop, occupy the central files with rooks and pressure Pd4. White has used h2-h3 to prevent ...Bc8-g4xf3, but Pd4 will be a weakness for some time. White, on the other hand, has use of Pd4 and the control of e5 it provides. Black's most dangerous piece is the one which can attack Pd4, so Bc1-g5, aiming to trade for Be7, might be very good. Perhaps White should encourage Black to occupy d5 (a2-a3 Nb4-d5) with a minor piece, so the file won't be open and Pd4 might be more safe. Then White could focus on occupying and utilizing the e-file. } 13. Bg5 Nbd5 14. Re1 Be6 15. Qb3 { It doesn't seem to me the queen does well here; it competes with Bc4 for light squares. The idea is to combine pressure on d5 with the threat to Be7. If Black has to use Qd5 to defend d5 then what defends Be7. } ( 15. Bb3 ) 15...Qb6 ( { The obvious challenge } 15...b5 16.

Nxd5 $4 Bxg5 $17 ) 17...Nxe7 $13 { and Black has taken advantage of the existing alignment of Be6 with White's Qb3; also leaving Nc3, rather than trading it off, to keep the c-file closed } ) 16. Nxd5 cxd5 { Now neither side has perfect pawns, but Pd5 might possibly be the weakest. At least Black has kept the e-file closed, so Re1 isn't terribly useful  (yet) . } 17. Qxb6 { further ruining Black's pawns and giving Bc4 room to retreat to b3, continuing the threat to Pd5 } 17...axb6 18. Bb3 { The c-file is now open, but there's no way for Black to invade at c2 (Bb3 controls c2) . On the other hand, White might try to invade to c7. } 18...h6 19. Bf4 Rfc8 { Black's pieces seem to have everything covered except e5. Next he has to figure out how to exchange pieces to lead to an equal endgame. White will avoid most exchanges, but how can he make progress? I suppose f2-f4-f5 is one way of disturbing the coordination of Black's position. } 20. Ne5 g5 { This appears to be chasing Bf4 toward a less useful square, but it might also serve to prevent f2-f4-f5. Unfortunately, for Black, it also shows up later as a weak point, not easily supported by pieces. } 21. Bh2 Bb4 ( 21...Ne4 { heading to d2 to chase Bb3 off the b3-d5 diagonal } ) 22. Re2 Ne4 23. Nd3 Bf8 24. Rae1 { White has apparently decided he still has more chance for success via the e-file than anywhere else. How is he going to move Be6 off the file? } 24...Bg7 { This seems odd to me. Of course, White doesn't have time for f2-f3 because ...Bxd4 is check, giving Black time to retreat ...Ne4-f6. But, it probably leads to a trade of dark-square bishops, something Black has been avoiding. } ( 24...Nd6 { The knight might go to c4 to block Bb3 or it could go to either b5 or f5 to target Pd4. } ) 25. Be5 Bxe5 { I don't see what Black gains by this exchange. } ( { Also insufficient seems to be } 25...f6 26. Bh2 f5 27. Be5 $14 ) 26. Nxe5 Kg7 27. Nd3 Rc7 28. Nb4 Rd8 { Can't anyone see why White is continuing to try to win, isn't it obvious he has tremendous potential? How can a Grandmaster achieve victories when he begins with this kind of position? Even Fischer, known for squeezing out points from such positions, had great difficulty against the better defenders of his day, such as Petrosian. } 29. g4 ( 29. Nxd5 Bxd5 30. Bxd5 Nxf2 31.

Rxe6 fxe6 33. Rxe6 Rcd7 34. Rxb6 { is possibly better for White since he would have more pawns, but the same number of pieces (though one is a bishop fighting a Black rook) } ) 32. Kg3 Kf8 33. h4 { Pg5 is hard for Black to support and White can simply push through over there, aiming eventually for g4-g5 to kick Nf6 away from the defense of Pd5. I know that may seem odd, since there are pawns in the way, but if Pg5 has to give way after h3-h4xg5 and f3-f4xg5, then White will indeed be able to put a pawn at g5. } 33...Bb5 34. Re5 gxh4+ 35. Kxh4 Bc4 { In a general sense every one of Black's pawns is bad, but his pieces are wel placed to complement them. It's not so easy for White to make inroads. } 36. Bc2 { White can try to chase Bc4 by playing a2-a4 (cutting off one retreat square) and then b2-b3. Bc4 is well placed, but can be chased to a horrible a6. } 36...Bb5 $1 { If White chases it now with a2-a4 the bishop retreats on the b5-e8 diagonal and Pa4 is suddenly a target! Incidentally, Black might now threaten ...Rc7-c4, hitting Nb4 and Pd4. } 37. a3 Rd8 38. Kg3 Kg7 39. Bf5 Kf8 40. Rh1 Kg7 41. Nc2 { White is making a definite shift toward the king-side. I suppose he feels more confident of achieving something after g4-g5 and he wants to attack Black's king. Whether Black just exchanges pawns, opening the h- and g-files, or moves Nf6, there will be some room for White's pieces in that area. Black's rooks have to react somehow to oppose White's rooks. } 41...Re8 42. Ne3 Rce7 43. Kf4 Bc6 44. Bc2 Bd7 45. g5 { White's dominance of the dark squares should remind Black of why he traded dark-square bishops, weakening his control of e5. }

1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. e5 { This, the Caro-Kann, Advance Variation, makes a lot more sense for Topalov than the Classical Variation (3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5) . He will have more opportunity to create complex, perhaps even confusing, positions. This suits his style and not Bareev's. } 3...Bf5 4. Nc3 ( 4. Nf3 { Is a White approach which pretty much ignores Bf5 and aims for: Be2, Be3, c2-c4, Nb1-c3 with mostly queen-side play. } ) 4...e6 { Black has a solid light square pawn structure, as in a French Defense, but with his light square bishop "outside" the chain. Black has spent one extra tempo  (...c7-c6) to achieve this. Is it worth it? Some people believe Bf5 is just an exposed target. } 5. g4 { This is the very aggressive attempt to refute the early ...Bc8-f5. It's played before Black can use ...h7-h5 to secure the light squares even further. } 5...Bg6 6. Nge2 Ne7 ( 6...h5 7. Nf4 { If Bg6 moves it will cost a pawn. If it stays Nf4xg6 will ruin Black's king-side pawns. } ) ( 6...c5 { to generate some queen-side offense, and hopefully deflect White's attention from Bg6, has been played quite a lot, perhaps mostly } ) 7. f4 c5 ( 7...h5 8. f5 exf5 9. g5 f4 10.

After this move Black will have to keep an eye open for opportunities to play ...f5-f4 to reactivate Bg6. He might not want to do that when White can play Nxf4 and follow with e5-e6 to continue breaking up Black's king's protection. } 10...Nec6 11. Bg2 cxd4 { At this stage of the game, and with the lines opening up, White has to take into consideration where his king will reside for the long run. Earlier he might have planned to O-O-O, but now that doesn't seem as likely. Pd4 prevents the simple Bc1-e3, Qd1-d2, O-O-O, so O-O seems more likely; and in that event it might be better to leave Pd4 to keep the c5-g1 diagonal closed. So, Ncxd5, O-O and Ne2-f4 followed by e5-e6 to further force an opening toward Ke8 seems to be the plan. } 12. Nxd5 Nd7 { Black intends to get rid of Pe5 before it can be supported at e6, so White has to get rid of Pd4 to keep material equality or White can gambit Pe5, knowing the open e-file will be of use: 13.

To that end White has often, in recent years, aimed for Bf1-d3, Qd1-e2, O-O-O to bring the rook to the center quickly and to enable more free-wheeling king-side aggression. } 6. Nf3 ( 6. Nxf6+ Nxf6 7. Nf3 h6 8. Bh4 Be7 9.

Bxf6 Nxf6 ) 7...Bxf6 8. h4 { This allows White to maintain some tension, but would appear to commit the king to the queen-side. Black, on the other hand, is probably wondering if his king would truly be safe on the king-side. } 8...c5 { Black usually aims to play ...Qd8-a5+ to get out of a pin on the g5-d8 diagonal. It helps in some cases to get rid of White's Pd4 to prevent White from having complete control of e5. It also limits Black's freedom to ...O-O-O and it takes a tempo away from piece development. } ( 8...h6 { kicks the bishop,but makes Ph6 a target for later } 9. Be3 ) ( 8...Qe7 9. Qd2 b6 10.

It blocks the d-file and chases Qb4, but it also loses contact with d7, where it was useful preventing difficulties on the a4-e8 diagonal. } ( 12...Qe7 ) 13.

Rh3 a6 {This is an obvious, if highly risky, attempt to get Ra8 developed before Kc7 has to go back behind the pawns. Fritz 4 suggests ...Rh8-c8 and ...Kc7-b8, but what would become of Ra8? Black has to be very careful to properly balance his king's safety with attempts to achieve piece activity. } ( 17...Qb4+ 18.

Rxd5 exd5 26. Rc3 Qxc3 27. bxc3 $18 ) 23. Nxb5+ $1 { This move might seem a little speculative, but on principle Ka7 will never be safe and White's pieces have more open lines to go get him. Black won't have time to develop his rooks, so their value is almost nil, until you get a simplified endgame. } 23...axb5 24. Rxb5 Qc6 25. Rdxd5 exd5 26. Qe7+ Ka6 27. Rb3 { This at least wins Black's queen. Black hasn't maintained his king's safety and that lead to him having to defend rather than developing Rh8 and Ra8. Although White is behind a rook it's the one he has on b3 which is more useful than both of Blacks! It also helps that his king is rock solid safe. }

Moving f2-f4 would help threaten Black on the king-side. } 18...Rb8 { again considering ...c5 since Pb4 is pinned as Bb2 isn't defended Black could also have considered a simple maneuver of ...Nf6-h7-g5-e6-d4 to add more force at the center and toward the queen-side. } 19.

Nf3 { Many moves have been tried; this one is useful without exposing to White the way White intends to play his pawns. For example, should Black play ...bxc4 and allow Nb1-c3 then White might follow with Nf3-d2xc4 with excellent coordination. Usually Black leaves Pb5 to maintain his options. } ( 4. cxb5 { is probably the most common attempt } ) 4...g6 ( 4...e6 { Blumenfeld Gambit -- pressures Pd5 while White doesn't have Nc3 to support it } ) 5. cxb5 a6 { Black offers this pawn to open the queen-side further, expecting his improved piece activity to compensate for the pawn. } 6. b6 { White refuses to cooperate and leaves Pa6 to block Bc8. Of course, he doesn't win a pawn this way either. } 6...d6 ( 6...Qxb6 ) 7.

Nd2 O-O 11. Be2 { At this point Black has an interesting choice to make. Some players have succeeded (as White) with a4-a5 and so some (as Black) have played ...a6-a5 and perhaps ...Ba6 to fight on the queen-side light squares. But, ...a5 weakens b5, so not everyone finds it appealing. But, what's the alternative plan for Black? Bc8 isn't developed, so ...e6 might soon be considered, but at the moment Pd6 is too weak for that. } 11...Rb8 12. O-O Qa7 13. Nc4 Nb6 { It looks like he's just trying to trade pieces to ease his cramp, but this can be risky because White has mobile central pawns and is close to having them very well supported. } 14.

Black has to commit to some other way of fighting actively. } ( 14. a5 $2 Nxc4 15. Bxc4 Bd7 { and ...Bb5 completes Black's development and establishes pretty good coordination } ) 14...Bd7 15.

White hasn't got enough of a lead in development (if any) to do any damage. } 17. dxe6 Bxe6 18. b3 { White switches to a policy of securing the light squares, and I'd guess moving Ra1, before even thinking of how to threaten Black's central pawns. This might give Black an opportunity. Na5 is only defended when Nc3 moves, but if Nc3 moves it exposes Ra1. Would Black trade Bg7 for Ra1? I think so.

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3.

The move also works to enable O-O quickly. 3. Bc4 is interesting and has been played recently, but 3. d4 is still the most common move. } 3...Nc6 { This is unusual, but not necessarily bad. If White captures Nc6 Black can recapture ...b7xc6 and have better central control. Perhaps Polgar is trying to take Kasparov out of familiar territory. } ( 3...Bd7 ) ( 3...Nd7 ) 4. Bxc6+ bxc6 5. O-O ( 5. d4 cxd4 6. Qxd4 e5 { and Black's better central pawns prevent White from maintaining his Qd4 } ) 5...e5 $6 { This makes Bf8 bad and doesn't prevent White from playing c2-c3, d2-d4 to open the center. } ( { Black can immediately target Pb2 with ...Bg7 and ...Rb8 (or ...Qb6) , but mostly she should use Bg7 in cooperation with her dark-square pawn chain. } 5...g6 6. e5 d5 7. h3 { and Black should be in good shape while White has to justify his (possibly overextended) Pe5 } ) 6. c3 { Already Black faces a crisis since White is better developed and Ke8 might soon be exposed. } 6...g5 { This could be the move of a complete amateur or of a great player such as Ivanchuk, but it seems out of place and unusual, for Polgar. This may be a small indication of an internal struggle wherein she tries to expand her approach, hopefully for the better. In this case I think it just fails. } ( 6...Be6 7. d4 cxd4 8. cxd4 f6 9. Qa4 Qd7 10. Nc3 Ne7 { is clearly easier for White to play and Qd7 isn't very mobile, so White should aim for Rd1 and dxe5 to continue opening lines. } ) 7. d4 $1 { Opening the center is more important than the pawn he appears to be gambitting. } 7...g4 8.

Well, first of all Pa7 is en prise, so White has to decide whether there is time to capture it and then return to the main theme. } 19. Qe3 ( 19.

Nd4 Bd8 { perhaps considering ...Bd8-b6, but also clearing e7 to develop Ng8-e7-g6 } 21. Qd2 Ne7 { This position requires a comment. It appears Black has secured her king, but there's more of interest here. Black's advanced king-side pawns might give her a chance for some offense while it's not really clear White has any offense at all. The only factor which makes the position really murky is the blocked center. White has more space and Qd7 is dreadful, but can White actually penetrate Black's position? White can advance his queen-side pawns, but the king-side seems to be in Black's hands! This is an amazing realization to make after that peculiar opening. Perhaps a classicist would simply indicate that the immediate position doesn't appear winning for White, but Black will be compelled to make more moves and in so doing will unravel. We'll see. } 22. b5 Ng6 23. Nc6 c3 $5 { chasing White's queen away from control of d4, so ...Bb6 can't be met by Nc6-d4 } ( 23...Bb6 24. Nd4 ( 24. a4 g3 ) 24...Nxf4 25. Qxf4 Bxd4 26.

Allowing exf6 is extremely risky. If only there was another way, but I see none. I suppose this is where the classicist says, "I told you so." Black is having difficult with Qd7 because White dominates in the center, cramping Black quite a lot. So, when Black fights back those central pieces spring into action! } 31. exf6 Qh7 { threatening ...Rxh2+ mating } 32. f7+ Bxf7 ( 32...Kf8 33. Qxh8+ Qxh8 34. Rxe6 ) 33.

Nec8 { This is a marvelous situation: Bf7 is pinned, Nh8 is stuck defending Bf7 and Qh7 & Rh5 can only sit on the h-file, but they can't open it.

This was quite an exciting game with the odd appearances and Polgar's heroic effort to gain piece activity, only to have it fall apart as they neared the time control (assuming that was move 40) . }

1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 { Black attacks Pe4 when it's a little inconvenient for White to defend that pawn. Whether the advance e4-e5 makes the pawn weaker is a key question to be answered by the following play. In any event Black figures he'll have gained development (Ng8-f6) . } ( 2...d5 ) 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nf3 { This is preferred to 3. d4 cxd4 4. cxd4 Qa5+ when White has to play the awkward Bc1-d2 or Nb1-d2 (if he's to avoid a simplifying queen trade) . It has become the "normal" move. Being a good piece development it can't be bad, but d2-d4 is still quite likely to be played, and soon. } 4...Nc6 5. Bc4 Nb6 6. Bb3 d5 { This converts the position quite dramatically (presuming White doesn't capture it en passant) to something akin to a French Defense or Caro-Kann Defense pawn structure. Black has the freedom to move ...Bc8-f5 or ...Bc8-g4 rather than locking it in behind the pawns with ...e7-e6. The location of Bb3 is also odd, but not necessarily bad. That bishop could move to c2 and be on the desirable b1-h7 diagonal. One curious development is that Nb6 is a little awkward. So, despite some similarities to other openings, this one has it's own particulars and must not be confused with those other openings. } 7. exd6 { Well, that changes it back to an open (or semi-open) center, where the better piece activity will generally be of primary importance. Just straight-forward counting of development moves would seem to indicate Black is o.k. } 7...Qxd6 8. O-O Be6 $5 { I've not seen this before. It directly challenges White's light-square bishop and avoids the "obvious" pinning of Nf3, which is an error met quickly by 9. Bxf7+ Kxf7 10. Ng5+. } 9. Na3 { This is pretty common in this opening, though usually after d2-d4 has been played. In this position the two sides are fighting over the light squares. If Black can get rid of Bb3 he might occupy square d3, which would prevent the easy development of Bc1 and Ra1. How does Na3 prevent that? } ( 9. Bxe6 Qxe6 10. d4 ) 9...Bxb3 10. Qxb3 Qd3 11. Qb5 O-O-O { There is an obvious weakness at f7, so I'd presume Gelfand has given this careful thought. If he can tactically support O-O-O then he'll have a clear advantage -- already. } 12. Ng5 ( 12.

The big pawn at b2 is the cornerstone of White's position (remarkably) and it's about to disappear. This was a rather amazing game in that White avoided the obviouly necessary d2-d4 and was punished severely. }

Kf1 Rd2 { Black threatens simply Rd2-d5, Be8xh5, so g2-g4 has to be played after all. In this case it's bad for White because g2-g4 will entomb Rh4. } 51. g4 Rb2 52. Rh1 Kf7 53. Rh3 Kf6 54. f4 Rxb4 55. Rf3 Bd7 56. g5+ hxg5 ( 56...Kf5 { is also good because a rook trade leads to a won bishop & pawn ending. Black's bishop can control h1, so that even if he only has a rook pawn he can chase White's king out of the corner. } ) 57. fxg5+ Kxg5 58.

Bc1-g5xf6 was a threat to Black's king. At this point Black has defended and (surprisingly) the position looks somewhat like a Sicilian Defense, Sveshnikov Variation. White's play on the d-file can't really pay off (winning Pd6 is very difficult) , but using d5 and the a-file can provide a way to play where Bf6 can't defend! } 20. Nc2 Nc8 21. Nb4 Qb7 22.
