{00001.4.4 Analyzed by National Master Corey Russell} 1. e4 Nf6 2. d3 d6 3. Nc3
Nfd7 {A very bad move. In the opening stages of the game, do NOT move a piece
twice without first developing your other pieces, except to prevent loss of
material. In the beginning, there are 3 elements that are very important: 1)
Development -- getting pieces out of their home squares 2) Center control, and
3) space. Black should've staked some central control by playing either ...c5
or ...e5.} 4. Be3 e6 5. Nf3 {Because of black's particularly passive play,
there's no reason white should not do 5. f4! right away to gain more SPACE and
central control (e5 square). Notice white plays f4 later anyways, albeit after
a lot of maneuvering.} Be7 6. Qe2 b6 7. O-O-O Bb7 8. Kb1 {There isn't a good
reason for this move. Simply 8. d4, staking claim in the center and opening up
the f1-a6 diagonal for the white's light-squared bishop is more logical.} a6 {
Again, black needs to control the center. ...c5! and Nc6! would give black a
fighting chance.} 9. d4 O-O 10. e5 {Good! You're locking up the center to give
yourself a free hand on the king-side.} d5 11. h4 Nc6 {VERY bad. Black needs
open lines for his pieces, including . ...c5! is the natural way to do that,
followed by ..Nc6, ...Rc8, and mabe ...cxd4. This would also weaken white's
protection of his e5 pawn once the d4 pawn falls. The general principle is:
Attack the base of pawn chains. For white, this is e6, and for black it is d4.
Note that eventually, White indeed does attack the base of black's pawn chain,
which was black's fatal error.} 12. g3 h6 {Black should've avoided weakening
his king position. Again, ..Na5 and ...c5 was mandatory. White could've taken
advantage of this mistake by playing 13. g4!, followed by h5, Rg1, and g5
opening up lines on black's king side immediately.} 13. Nh2 Re8 {
Black misses many chances to play ...c5, which is his correct plan.} 14. f4 Na5
15. b3 {This weakens your king position unnecessarily. Since there is no
threat, white can play g4! with a strong attack. For example, if 15. ... Bxh4
16. Nf3 Be7 17. g5, and white opens the h-file to fatal effect, because of
mate threats involving Qh2. And if black declines white's pawn, white can
simply play g5, opening up black's king side.} Nb8 16. Qf3 Qd7 17. Bd3 Bb4 18.
Bd2 Nbc6 {Of course, ...c5! would be very strong for black. For example, 18. ..
. c5 19. Ne2 Bxd2 20. Rxd2 c4 21. bxc4 Nxc4 22. Bxc4 (forced because of the ...
Qb5+, Ka1, Qb2 mate threat) dxc4 23. Qf1 Bxh1 would leave black with a winning
position!} 19. Ne2 Bxd2 20. Rxd2 Rad8 21. f5 Na7 22. f6 N5c6 23. h5 {

hxg6 Na3+ 26. Ka1 Nxc2+ 27. Rxc2 Kf8 28. Nf3 {This wins, but the fastest win
is 28. g7+ Kg8 29. Qh5, with the idea of Qxh6 and Qh8 checkmate.} fxg6 29. Qxg6
Re7 30. Rxh6 {Good! Playing only for mate, as the rook on e7 is irrelevant.
The pawn on f6 is very dangerous to black's king position.} Rh7 31. Rxh7 Qxh7

good placement with the piece's safety. If pawns can push your piece around,
then that's not a very good square either. Otherwise, you did fairly well with

your knight into the game, and help control the center. When getting your

this move does not control the center, and this weakens white's kingside. Pawn
to d4 makes more sense.} h5 {Much stronger is 2 ... d5. This gets a foothold
in the center, opens up a line for your bishop on c8, and to boot forces white
to move one of his pieces again, since the Rook on h3 is threatened by black's

now your h-pawn can't cover it.} 3. e3 d5 4. Bb5+ c6 5. Ba4 b5 6. Bb3 Qd6 {

but by going over a loss, trying to find out what went wrong, and how to
improve, will reap great results. I myself did the same when I was a youth,
and by continually going over games that I lost/drew, I found out what I did
wrong, and resolved not to repeat them. I did go over wins as well to look for
improvements, but rarely did I learn as much. BTW, I have a feeling that if

{00015.4.22 Analyzed by Candidate Master Daniel Waite All right! Courage! You
will learn more from your losses than you will from your wins. If you study
the games you lose you will see the patterns that get you in trouble and
common mistakes you make. If you minimize these then you will improve quickly.
A good source for this study might be Soltis' "Catalogue of Chess Mistakes."} 
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 d6 {Your move is a tad unusual but it works.
Typically the King's Bishop often finds its way to c4. Traditionally the idea
is to play 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 first.} 4. O-O Be6 {Your opponent errs. The one
thing you must be aware of in the Opening is to grab any and all chances to
wreck your opponents pawn structure. Look at 5. Bxe6 fxe6 6. d4 cxd4 7. Nxd4
Nxd4 8. Qxd4 Nf6 9. f4. This may be my personality but I feel Black has
serious problems organizing anything useful with the shattered pawn structure.
The only redeeming quality is that Black as three center pawns.} 5. d3 Bxc4 6.
dxc4 Nf6 7. Re1 g6 8. Bf4 Bg7 {Remember to play with a plan! The last few
moves are setting up a nice attack but do you understand what you are trying?
Often we hear the mantra to develop, so we develop and miss the point behind
why we are making the move. The idea of the opening is to create an
"imbalance" [any difference in the position] - especially in minor piece
position - and develop around it. One idea of developing the Bishop to f4 is
to play h3 to give the Bishop a safe haven while keeping the Knight at bay.
BTW the pawns at e4 and c4 are considered a strong strategy against the
Sicilian.} 9. Nc3 O-O 10. Rb1 Ng4 {Here you have to look at playing 10. Qd2
with the idea of playing Bh6 to rid the game of the Dragon Bishop. Also
tempting is to blast the center with 10. e5!} 11. Nd5 Qa5 {
It always helps when your opponent misses a solid move. /\Nge5} 12. h3 Nf6 13.
e5 Nh5 {It looks like your move loses a pawn but it is a gutsy idea. The
aggressiveness of your play will help you as you learn the various tactical
possibilities of a position. One suggestion is to concentrate on pattern
recognition. Learn the various patterns behind combinations. There are
probably only about 20 common ones.} 14. Bg5 Qxa2 {Ouch. Black begs White to
finish the game in a clean stroke. There is an "urban legend" that tells of a
rich guy that left his son a vast fortune on the condition that he would never
play Qxa2 even if it were the correct move. 14/\dxe4 or 14/\f6 was necessary
to hold the balance.} 15. Nxe7+ Nxe7 16. Bxe7 Rfc8 17. b3 dxe5 {I find in my
lost games that I generally had a "big miss." Well, this one is yours. After
17. exd6 the game is over, you can hear the "fat lady warming up." The pawn on
d6 moves to d7 and completely chokes Black's middle. The Black Rooks become
totally useless and you own all the important squares. All this is helped by
the useless placement of the Black Queen. Even 17. Ng5 does close to mortal
damage to Black threatening both 18. exd6 and 18. Qd5.} 18. Nxe5 Nf4 19. Re4
Re8 {Please, do not help your opponent! Remember, never force your opponent to
do something you will regret. 19. Qc1! Attacks the Knight on f4, if that is
what you want, and holds the back line down nicely. One thing you must learn
is when a threat is real and when it is not. The ideal is to ignore your
opponent's threats and execute your own. To do this you must learn to
distinguish between the real and the imagined.} 20. Nd3 Nxd3 21. Re2 Nf4 {
21. cxd3 was necessary. It is ugly but playable. It's better than what
happened. White is saddled with two "backward" pawns - on d3 and on b3. I'd
call this a positional nightmare, but against a weak opponent you will have an
interesting fight on your hands. The squares in front of them are called
"holes" where Black will plant a piece. This is called a "blockade." The
strength of a blockade is that the pawn is immobile. In chess, if it doesn't
[or can't] move it will suffer violence. Keep your position as flexible as
possible while coaxing your opponent into making his as ridged as possible.
Another strength of the blockade is that it is a base of operation against the
opponent. The blockader can not be attacked through the weak pawn.} 22. Re1 b6
23. Bg5 Rxe1+ {23. Qf3 or 23. Rc1. Your idea of chasing the Knight with the
Bishop is misguided and at this point fatal. Don't attack something for the
sake of attacking. Always ask yourself, "what is my opponent threatening?" "If
I move this what can my opponent threaten or take?" You must have a solid
positional reason to attack. Generally if it is mobile, look somewhere else
unless you are attempting to create a weakness such as immobility or a poorly
defended piece. As much as possible "over protect" everything [pieces and
important squares]. By creating an interlocking web of pieces you will make
them "all" mobile [perfect for attack or defense]. Think "internet." Anything
that "inters" it doesn't leave with all its body parts.} 24. Qxe1 Ne2+ 25. Kf1
Qxc2 26. b4 cxb4 27. Rxb4 Re8 28. c5 bxc5 {O.K. your opponent is mortal after
all. He misses the "discovered attack." 28/\Ng3+ 29. fxg3 Rxe1+. This can be
crushing if there is a check involved. Of course 28/\Bc3 forking Qe1 & Rb4
works. Next time you see him, feel free to point this out to him and gloat
that he missed "all" the big moves in this game! - grin} 29. Rb5 c4 30. f3 c3 {
Black misses mate in five [forced]. Cover the screen and figure it out. 30/
\Ng3+ 31. Kg1 Rxe1+ 32. Kh2 Nf1+ 33. Kh1 Ne3+ 34. Kh2 Qxg2#. You should be
able to follow this in your mind and see it at the board because they are all
forced moves. Track forced moves all the way through. Always consider check. A
check is a free move. Following a "line of checks" often leads to checkmate.}
31. g4 Qd3 32. Rc5 Qxf3+ 33. Qf2 Qh1+ 34. Qg1 {O.K. so he got you in four
moves, but he needed your help. An idea to prolong the game would have been to
move your Q to b1 instead of moving the pawns. I suspect when you start moving
pawns you are out of plans. Suggestions for improvement: Keep up the slash and
attack style. Be a threat to everyone you meet. Put some effort into learning
pawn play. "Pawns are the soul of chess." Most plans revolve around the pawn
structure. If you get this down you will become difficult for the "sharks"
[2000+ players] to handle. Don't give away pieces! Don't force your opponent
to do anything you will regret. Don't panic - if you find yourself tempted to
move pawns sit on your hands and breath [that's when you inhale and exhale air
from your lungs - I often forget in a tense game] then look for a logical line
that the position demands. Keep examining your lost games, your courage will
take you far! [I read that on a "Chinese fortune" cookie once - grin.] Develop
an attitude: If my opponent can beat me they will have to do it without my

This position is known as the Center Counter, or Scandinavian defense. While
objectively sound for black, I don't recommend it as this early queen sortie,
as it doesn't help black's central control much, plus black always has to be
careful where he moves his queen again, as the monarch is always pushed around
by White with an eventual Nc3 or c4. If black isn't careful, he could lose his
queen easily, as this game demonstrates.} 3. d4 Nc6 {A good move by black. He
gets his knight out, while at the same time puts pressure on White by
threatening to capture on d4.} 4. Nf3 Nf6 {Natural, but inaccurate. An
aggressive ...Bg4! followed by castling queenside could really put the
pressure on White's center. For example, if ...Bg4 5. c4?? Qe4+ 6. Be2 Bxf3 7.
gxf3 Qxd4 leaves black up a pawn! This is one reason why it's common for white
to boot black's queen from the center as soon as possible by playing Nc3 move
2. As it stands, white gets a free hand to push black around.} 5. c4 Qa5+ {
? This only forces white to develop his bishop with a gain of time. Black has
to accept the fact his only reasonable posts for her is d6 or d8.} 6. Bd2 Qb6

this, White has a won game, and you played well to convert it.} Qxb2 8. Bc3

This pawn sacrifice was unjustified by White. With best play, black should win.
} 3. Bb2 Nf6 4. e4 Nc6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. g3 Nd4 {Black could've won another pawn
using a tactical motif called, "Removing the Defender". 6. ... Bxc3 7. Bxc3
Nxe4. White cannot take on e5, or he will lose at least a piece because of the
pin on the e-line.} 7. Bg2 d6 8. O-O Bg4 9. h3 Nxf3+ 10. Bxf3 Bxf3 {Why not win
the pawn on h3? White can't trap the Bishop with 11. g4 since by taking the
pawn, the bishop would also threaten the rook at f1. This concept is known as
gaining a tempo.} 11. Qxf3 b5 {?! Definitely dubious. This makes black's pawn
structure slightly weaker. Why not solidfy central control with ...c6, Re8,
with a ...d5 expansion? Remember, when ahead in material, trade pieces, not
pawns.} 12. Nxb5 Bxd2 {As a result of this interchange, white has 3 pawn
islands, black has 2. A pawn island is a group of pawns separated by open
files. This should give black a slight endgame advantage. The reason that
fewer pawn islands is better, is that they don't need pieces to defend them
(they can defend each other).} 13. Rad1 Rb8 14. Rxd2 Rxb5 15. Ba3 Ra5 {
Remember your heavy pieces (Queen, rooks) want to double on the open file
(column). Therefore, Qb8 would be quite strong, to establish b-file control.
Black could follow-up with ...Qb7 (pressuring white's e-pawn), ...Rfb8, and/or
Rb1 with a definite edge for black.} 16. Rd3 Qb8 {...Qa8! (pressuring white's
e-pawn again) is quite strong... white would have to be tied down with Re1,
then Rb8, followed by the killer shot ...d5 (white can't take because ...e4
would fork white's queen and rook).} 17. Rb3 Qc8 18. Qc3 Ra6 19. Qc4 Nd7 {
The knight was already good on f6. Better was to oppose white's control of the
b-file with ...Rb6. This would also free your queen from defense of the rook
on a6, so ...Qxh3 is a real threat.} 20. Rfb1 Rb6 21. f4 {This is a dubious
line opening by white. There are too many hanging white pawns, plus this opens
up White's king considerably.} Rxb3 22. axb3 Nb6 23. Qf1 exf4 24. Qxf4 {
This is obviously an oversight by white. White had to play gxf4, and if black
tries to open things up with ..f5, then e5 gives White a fighting chance.} Qxh3
25. Rd1 Nc8 {Why not ...Nd7? The post on e5 would be very strong for black.
Remember, if you can, try to centralize your knights... they drive a wedge in
your opponent's position.} 26. e5 Rd8 27. exd6 cxd6 28. Bxd6 {? This loses.
White's bishop is much stronger than the knight at c8, plus when behind in
material trade pawns, not pieces. Since black's d-pawn is pinned, c4 looks
likes White's best chance. Now black can win a piece with ...Qe6. Remember
attack pinned pieces! You might win them.} Nxd6 29. c4 Nb7 30. Rxd8+ Nxd8 31.
Qb8 Qd7 32. b4 Kf8 33. c5 Ke8 34. b5 a5 {This is not right. ..Qd4+, then ...
Qxc5 would force white to resign. Notice ...Qxc5 defends a7, covers e5 against
potential checks by the white queen, and helps restrict white's b-pawn. Why
does the black queen do so much? Because it's centralized! I can't emphasize
the importance of this enough.} 35. b6 {White had much stronger, c6! This
threatens c6-c7-c8(Q). Black would be forced to take the draw by perpetual
check! Remember, 2 connected passed pawns are very strong. White's move allows
a light-squared blockade by black.} Qb7 {
?? This loses by force! Again, ...Qd4+, 36. Kh1 Qxc5 37. b7 Qb5 wins for black.
} 36. Qe5+ {? White could have had a beautiful win with 36. Qxb7 Nxb7 37. c6
Nc5 38. b7 Na6 39. c7!!, and black can't stop white from queening.

black's less than ideal knight on b6).} cxd5 12. Bd2 Bf5 13. Qd1 Rc8 14. Ba5
Qd6 15. Bxb6 axb6 16. Qe2 {An automatic move...this connects rooks, but that's
about it. Instead Qd2 is stronger. This would prevent blacks' queen from
infiltrating b4, help insure white can contest the c-file (since the Q would
be covering c1), and indirectly hinders an e5 break by black (because the
black d-pawn would be hit by white's queen and bishop. Also, ...Bg4, followed
by ...Bxf3, gxf3 is not dangerous for white. Remember: a weakness is only a
weakness if it can be taken advantage of! This motif is seen often in
Grandmaster (GM) chess.} Bg4 17. h3 Bxf3 18. Qxf3 e6 19. Rac1 Qb4 20. Qe2 Rc6
21. Rxc6 {? Now black mobilizes his pawns, white's bishop is bad, and will
activate black's bishop as well, not to mention undoubling black's pawns for
him. Because of the opposite colored bishops, white could put a much stiffer
reistance by playing 21. Qd3 Rfc8 22. Rcd1!, and black has no access points
(c2 is covered by the light squared bishop), and no way to boot white's bishop.
Note that even if black sac'd his rook on c4 at some point, white doesn't even
have to take it! Also, the d-line pressure would discourage a ...e5 break by
black. White would basically "shuffle", since black can't break through.} bxc6

Rg2 {A well-played game by black...black made the most of his opportunities.
With this game, it's hard to answer your question about strength...white made
a number of positional errors, and black could be anywhere from an A-class
player to grandmaster. I need more games to make a better evaluation in that
regard. White played approx. B-player strength. Keep at it, and always go over
any losses/draws you experience, so you can learn and improve even more.} Kf3 *

black B on c8 and N on f6 of a possible post on g4.} a6 {Black's last move is
rather dubious. In most King pawn openings, Piece play is everthing. Much more
logical is 7. ... cxd4 8. Nxd4 Re8, with a slightly cramped but solid position
for black. Notice that White can't play 9. Bg5? Nxe4! as this would win a pawn
for black.} 8. a4 h6 {There is no need for this move. Black should still play
the plan mentioned on move 7.} 9. a5 Re8 10. d5 Nb8 11. Ne1 Nh7 {? Definitely
a mistake. Black should of course continue development with ...Nbd7 instead,
with the idea of ...Nf8, Ng6, Bd7, c6 with a playable game. The text leaves
the center for no good reason.} 12. f4 {This is the right plan, just played
too early. Better would've been to prepare this move with Nd3, and possibly
even Kh2, g3, f4 so that way white can recapture f4 with a pawn and therefore
deprive the nice e5 square for black's pieces. As the game goes, white gets a
hole on e5. Squares that cannot be covered by pawns are called holes.} exf4 13.
Bxf4 Bf6 14. Qf3 Nd7 15. Nd3 {Alert play. It was critical for white to cover
c5 and e5 as soon as possible, to contest any knight outposts by black.} Qe7
16. Rae1 Ne5 {Another mistake by black. This is rather poor play for an expert.
The battle for e5 ("Fight for the Center") is key, therefore he should've
played ...Nf8! with the idea of Ng6, and the stranglehold control of e5 would
give him a small advantage.} 17. Bxe5 Bxe5 {Black makes what should've been
his last mistake. White can now win at least a pawn with 18. Nxe5 Qxe5 19.
Qxf7+ Kh8. If instead black tried 18. ... dxe5, then white has 19. d6! cxd6 20.

of the best ways that I suggest to not miss tactics is to always look at
forcing moves.} 18. Bb3 Ng5 19. Qh5 f6 {This unnecessarily weakens light
squares in Black's camp. The reason strong players avoid weakening their
squares if possible is to deny good outposts/lines for the opponent's pieces.
This is precisely what White correctly does in this game, and that is to play
on the light squares. Much better for black would be 19. ... g6! 20. Qe2 Bd7,
which would leave black with a slight advantage. Notice White can't play 20.

Nd1 Qf7 22. Qe2 Bd4+ 23. Kh1 Qg6 {Not very good, but postion has deteriated to
the point it's hard to suggest a good move. Black needed to complete
development with 23. ... Bd7 24. Bxd7 Qxd7, and reroute his Knight to e5 and
hope that that counterbalances his holes on e6 and f5. Notice that none of
this would be a problem if he would've played ...g6 earlier.} 24. c3 Ba7 25.
Bc2 Qe8 26. N1f2 Bd7 27. b3 {
Why not Nf4? if black replies ...Bb5, c4 is an effective rejoinder.} Nf7 28.

bishops of opposites may give chances to draw. With proper play though, black
should still win.} Bxe6 32. dxe6 Qxe6 33. Bd3 Kh8 {Black has been playing this
game entirely too passively. ...Qe5! is much stronger. That move blockades
white's e-pawn (hence hemming white's bishop in), threatens pawns on a5, c3,
and in addition threatens dark-square penetration to white's king-side with ...
Qg3 or ...Qg5.} 34. Qf3 Rae8 35. e5 {

move. If white's c-pawn were gone, black could draw by running his king to h8,

black can escape with a draw by stalemate, which is exactly what happened in
this game.} Kh8 66. Kh6 {So in conclusion, watch out for your opponent's
threats, and if you have passed pawns on the 7th rank (row), do all you can to
protect them. They can often decide games if they can queen, because they will
force more valuable pieces to sac themselves to stop it. Also, in endgames,
use your king to support your passed pawns, and to limit the activity of your
opponent's king.} *

don't recommend my students playing 1.d4 until they are about class "A"
strength. 1.d4 very often leads to strategic play, and 1.e4 is often direct
and tactical. The problem is, there are more strategical concepts than
tactical in chess, so 1.d4 is harder to play well. I know some players avoid 1.
e4 because of the theory involved, but once you understand positions resulting
of 1.e4, it really does help understanding 1.d4. This was true for myself.} d5

center.} e6 4. cxd5 exd5 5. g3 {Unfortunately, this is one of those positions
where the fianchetto of the bishop isn't very effective. White's bishop is
blocked by the black d-pawn, and there is no way to dislodge it except by an
eventual e4. But if white does that, then white will be obliged to recapture
with a piece, and this leaves white's d-pawn isolated. See all the strategical
concepts I was talking about? In this position, much more promising is quick
development with 5. Bg5, then a later e3, Bd3, Nf3, etc. The text should give
black a nice game.} Bb4 6. Bd2 {Unnecessarily passive. Quick king-side
castling is white's best chance for an advantage. Therefore 6. Bg2 is the best

fairly common in 1.e4.} Bxc3 {Black shouldn't have released the pressure.
Simply O-O is logical and strong. Black could then follow it up with ...Re8, ..

at c3.} 7. Bxc3 Ne4 8. Bg2 Nxc3 9. bxc3 Be6 10. e4 {?! Definitely dubious.

"baiting" is to set a trap. This game strategy is unsound since it is based on
what the player wants to do and not the demands of the position. Still a
misstep could be lethal. Unfortunately the constant "baiting" will eventually

This move is playable, but rather passive. Now your dark-squared bishop can't
be deployed to an active post. I would recommend the more active ...Nc6.} 3.

black win the game.} 12. Qf3 Bg7 {This misses white's threat. White has 2
pieces on the knight at f6 -- white will now a tactical idea called "removing
the defender", which should have won the game for white. Black's only defense
is ...Kf7. It wouldn't be too bad in this position, because if needed, black

a lot harder for black. Notice black couldn't even have tried 34. ... Rf8? in

{Analyzed by ?. Hi Everyone. Because the Kramnik-Deep Fritz. 7.0 match was
postponed I felt it necessary to analyze a game that Vladimir Kramnik played
against Deep Fritz 7.0 in his practice with the engine in preparation for his
match.} 1. c4 {The English Opening.} e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. Nf3 f5 $5 {The 3 Knights
Variation of the English Opening is a good system to use against Fritz. The
positions are closed in nature and there are very few forcing lines allowing
Kramnik to adjust his play to take advantage of the computer's weaknesses.} 4.
d4 e4 5. Ng5 Bb4 $5 {This continues to develop while not committing himself to
a specific line of play. For instance Fritz might play a known sac after 5...
Nf6 6. e3 h6 7. Nh3 g5 8. f3 exf3 9. Qxf3!? when play is very sharp, something
not to Kramnik's advantage. 9...g4?! is suicide in that line so after 9...d6
10. Nf2 Qe7 11. Nd5 (sacrificing a pawn) Nxd5 12. cxd5 Nb4 13. Bb5+ Kd8 14.
0-0 g4 15. Qe2 Nxd5 16. Nh1 and Fritz would have good compensation in a highly
tactical position. The text is much quieter and better suited to a human vs.
machine match.} 6. Nh3 Nf6 7. e3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 {Now white has two bishops. The
problem is the position is very closed in nature, so the bishops will have
little effect if the position isn't opened up. Kramnik should be very happy
after this exchange as his knights could become very active.} d6 9. Nf4 O-O 10.
h4 {Kramnik mentioned that all the moves up to here were played by the program
very quickly, meaning most of this is probably theory in the Fritz opening
book. Here we should take stock. Fritz just played a good move (10. h4)
securing his f4 knight by preventing the natural g5 advance by black. However,
the f4 knight seems like white's only trump. The pawns on c3 an c4 are weak,
black has the two knights in a closed position, and white's king is in the
center while black's is in safety. However, the c4 pawn has the useful
function of keeping the knight out of d5 while the c3 fellow solidifies d4.
White has a solid position, but unless the bishops can be unleashed, black
will have a slight advantage.} Qe7 $6 {Kramnik should leave e7 for the knight.
I suggest 10...Qe8 or 10...Ne7. The Qe8-f7 maneuver is very useful as it eyes
h5 and c4. 10...Ne7 allows black to play the prophylactic c5 to prevent the
freeing c5 move for white. For instance 10...Ne7 11. h5 c5! 12. Ba3 Qa5 etc.
and black has a "very" comfortable game though both Ng6 and Nh5 exchanging off
f4 is prevented. Or if 10...Qe8!? 11. Ba3 Qf7 12. h5 b6 and if white plays the
dubious 13. c5?! anyway, then 13...bxc5 14. dxc5 d5! and the black bishop is
shut in and black has the superior center and now the e5 square. After
Kramnik's 10...Qe7 move Fritz can free himself.} 11. c5 $1 {One might think 11.
h5 to be enough to secure the knight at f4 and thus the game in general, but
Fritz wants to trade off one of its weak pawns while trying to open the
position for his two bishops. The a2-g8 diagonal is now open for the bishop or
queen.} Nd8 $5 {Very nice! Let's examine the alternatives. The greedy, 11...
dxc5? (opening the position willingly!) 12. Bc4+ Kh8 13. h5! and white can
open the h-file decisively for instance if the natural 13...cxd4?? then 14.
Ng6+! hxg6 15. hxg6+ Nh7 16. Rxh7 Checkmate! If 11...d5 then 12. c4 simply and
white has the better of it. 11...Kh8 was a reasonable alternative too, but the
sacrifice with the text is probably the best defense against a computer who
can't resist accepting!} 12. Qb3+ Ne6 $5 {Possibly it's odd that black wants
to get rid of his knight in a situation favorable to knights. But he's willing
to get rid of one of his knights for the only active white bishop, the (soon
to be) c4 bishop.} 13. Bc4 Re8 14. Ba3 Kh8 {Ignoring threats on the b-pawn.
After the upcoming exchange, white's only active bishop is gone and black has
good counterplay.} 15. Bxe6 Bxe6 16. Qxb7 d5 $1 {The only move, but it still
deserves an exclamation mark. This ignores the threat on the c7 pawn as well.
Positionally speaking, this move is very effective at closing in the a3 bishop.
} 17. Rb1 $1 {Wow. The first time I've ever seen Fritz decline a pawn. If
Fritz doesn't see a mate in the line or decisive material advantage then he
usually grabs material without second thought. However, here he didn't see
decisive material advantage or mate and he DID declind the c7 pawn. Perhaps
Fritz is starting to understand the position more with the new version? The
other good alternative was 17. Qa6 with h5 to follow and white's comfortable
all around the board. If the greedy and bad 17. Nxe6? Qxe6 18. Qxc7 Qa6! 19.
Bb4 Rec8 20. Qa5 Qd3! 21. Rd1 Qc2 22. Qa6 Ng4 23. Qe2 Qa4 24. Qb2 f4 25. exf4
(25. Qb3 Qa6 is also wonderful for black) e3! 26. fxe3 Nxe3 and the proof is
in the pudding.} Bf7 18. Rb3 $2 {It's a completely understandable mistake.
Fritz is striving for bishop activity. 18. c6? can't be played because the a3
bishop would be hanging. Therefore Fritz logically defends it which allows him
to play c6. Fritz is forgetting about his more important minor piece! The f4
knight. It was imperitive to play 18. h5 to prevent any exchange of the f4
knight by Nh5 for instance. Once the knight goes the kingside belongs to black
and Kramnik will haven no trouble redirecting his forces.} Rec8 {
Threatening 19...c6! to prevent white's freeing move c6.} 19. c6 {Natural.} Qd8
20. Qa6 Nh5 $1 {From this point on, Black has good counterplay on the kingside.
What's the strategy called? Development! After the f4 knight leaves the
kingside black has a lead in development over on the kingside. Black can build
an initiative. All black's forces are out to pasture on the queenside. While
white attempts to win the a-pawn Black will be attempting to win the white
king!} 21. Nxh5 Bxh5 22. Rb7 $6 {This has the greedy motive behind it against
the a7 pawn. The a7 pawn is worthless though, more important is undermining
the key pawn at d5! I believe 22. c4!? would be much to Fritz's advantage.
Once the center opens, Fritz will have a raw calculating advantage as the
position would be very tacitcal despite white giving back some material. For
instance, 22. c4!? Bf7 23. cxd5 Bxd5 24. Rb7 Qe8 25. 0-0 if 25...Bxc6 then
simply 26. Rb2 Bd5 27. Rc1 Qf7 28. Rbc2 f4 29. Qd6! and white has solved the
potential kingside initiative while retaining the better of the two pawn
structures. After all the trades for instance 29...fxe3 30. fxe3 cxd6 31.
Rxc8+ Rxc8 32. Rxc8+ Qg8 33. Rxg8+ Kxg8 34. Bxd6 Bxa2 35. Kf2 and it should be
draw as Fritz's bishop controls the a-pawn's queening square. A draw would be
much better than the game result!} Qf6 $1 {With the white knight gone, black
starts his redeployment of forces on the kingside. No white pieces are in
position to defend the white king! The more passive 22...Be8?! sucuumbs to 23.
c4! The idea of Be8 of course is to work with Qf6 against the c-pawn. I like
the text. The bishop is nicely placed at h5 and there's no real reason to
retreat it. For instance after 22...Be8?! 23. c4! dxc4 24. Qxc4 Qf6 then 25.
d5! and c6 is granite anyway.} 23. O-O {
For once Fritz is worried more about king safety!} h6 $5 {This makes a place
for the king at h7 so as to not get mated on the 1st or second rank. This was
very important, of course. For instance if Kramnik immediately plays 23...
Bf3!? which is reasonable even here, then a line might occur like 23...Bf3! 24.
gxf3 exf3 25. Rfb1 Qxh4, but 26. Qd3! Qh3 27. Qf1 Qg4+ 28. Kh2 Qh4+ 29. Qh3 30.
Kh1 Re8 31. Rxc7 and if the natural rook lift 31...Re6 (idea e6-g6) then 32.
Rxg7! h6 33. Qxf5 Qh4+ 34. Kg1 f2+ 35. Kf1 Qh1+ 36. Kxf2 Qh2+ 37. Kf3 Rxe3+ 38.
Kxe3 Re8+ and black can only delay mate on the back rank or second rank by
checks. This is a very important move from that standpoint.} 24. Bc5 {
Greedy, Greedy. Much better is 24. g3!? where Bf3 has no threat because the h4
pawn is solid and white could simply continue with 25. Rfb1 etc. withadvantage.
Therefore a line might be 24. g3!? Kh7 25. Rfb1 Qe6 (eyeing c4) 26. c4 dxc4 27.
Qa5 if black tries to hold on to the c4-pawn with 27...Bf7 then 28. Rxc7 Rxc7
29. Qxc7 Rc8 30. Qxa7 Rxc6 31. Rb7 Ra6 32. Qc5 Ra8 33. Bb4!? Qg6 34. a3 Qh5 35.
Be1 Kg8 36. a4! Rf8 37. Bb4 Ra8 38. a5 Qd1+ 39. Kh2 Qf3 40. Be1 and white has
the d-pawn and a-pawn and not even the f4 break is enough for black.} Kh7 25.
Bxa7 Qxh4 {This is the beginning of the end. Now that the h4 pawn is gone,
black has a very strong sac Bf3! to effectively end the game.} 26. Rfb1 Bf3 $1
{Very strong. This natural sac probably wasn't found by the computer, else it
would've done something about it earlier.} 27. Qf1 {Of course if 27. gxf3 exf3
28. Qd3 Rf8! 29. Qd1 (only move) Qh5 30. Bb8 (intending use of b8-h2 diagonal
to defend) Raxb8 and the game's simply over.} Re8 28. Bb8 $5 {Fritz finds the
only way to defend. The idea is to take c7 with the bishop and use the
diagonal to help defend.} Raxb8 $1 29. Rxb8 Re6 $1 {Coming to g6 decisively.}
30. Rf8 Rg6 31. Rxf5 Rxg2+ 32. Qxg2 Bxg2 33. Kxg2 Qg4+ {And that's the point
of the combination. The rook on f5 is now black's. This was a stunning and
gorgeous win by the world champ against the flagship chessbase chess engine.
This proves that some humans can still excel over computers in tactics!} 0-1

{Analyzed by ?. Round 1 (Tournament still going on right now) First a note. I
felt obligated to my good friend Sofi to analyze some of her great games in
this tournament. I helped her prepare a little bit by playing various openings
against her at KasparovChess so she could get a wide variety of play
experience. I also gave a lecture which she helped me give of
Kasparov-Korchnoi back in Linares a couple years back. Therefore, it was
obvious she was very well-versed in the style of this wonderful, still
energetic veteran, Viktor Korchnoi. Unfortunately, she lost this 1st round
game, but the battle was nice and she missed a win. Viktor dragged it to a
lost endgame for white after good play from both sides. This proves how one
slip can hurt your winning chances.} 1. e4 e6 {No surprise here. The wonderful
veteran playing the black pieces is the French extraordinair of the 20th and
perhaps the 21st century! :) I know Sofi, and this was the first line she
prepared extensively for!} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5 {Sofi's pet variation
against the French from the white side. She never opted (at least not that I
remember) for 4. e5 Nfd7 5. f4 c5 etc. with slower spatial play. She's more of
a tactician hoping for the open game.} Be7 $5 {Apparently, this hadn't gone
unnoticed by the veteran. This forces white to play e5 and close up the game.
4...dxe4 was undoubtedly what Sofi was hoping for, however I'm sure she
prepared for this.} 5. e5 Nfd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 a6 {This idea Viktor uses is
not new by any means. 7...a6!? has the idea of pushing to b5 and bringing the
bishop out on b7. It's a solid line, which doesn't waste time as it may seem
with the wing pawn advance. Why is that exactly? I thought we were taught that
all unneeded wing pawn advances are a waste of time? However, tempo has a less
binding effect in the closed game. This position is very closed. The kings
don't "need" to get to safety immediately, the development of pieces quickly
is not quite as important as staking out space with pawns in this type of game.
Therefore, 4...a6 is a useful strategic move that doesn't lose tempo to any
serious extent.} 8. Nf3 c5 9. Qd2 Nc6 10. dxc5 $1 {This capture is well timed.
Because the e5 pawn is covered solidly by its counterpart at f4 it's ok that
the d-pawn leave e5's defense. More importantly this profits white the nice d4
square to plop a knight when the time is right. Note that after Sofi's 10th
move there are no pawns that can currently chase away the knight at d4.} Qxc5
11. Bd3 b5 12. a3 $1 {The best move. Natural would seem 12. Ne2 gaining total
control over d4, however 12. Ne2 succumbs to 12...b4! This nice move prevents
c3 and targets the c2 pawn rather effectively. after 13. a3 Qb6! and white's
king is stuck in the center for some time. Therefore, it's imperitve that
white prevent b4. Sofi does just that.} Bb7 13. Qf2 {This is still theory.
This is obviously a needed move. The black queen at her current post is far
too menacing. Also played before was 13. b4?! This possibly natural move is
very, very bad. This weakens a whole row of squares on the c-file. The plan
for black would hardly be difficult then. I like Sofi's choice a lot. The
queen exchange would definitely benefit her. If 13. Ne2?! then simply 13...
Qb6! (13...b4!? is possible too) and black's just fine once again. He'll
simply continue with Rc8 and Nc5 with a wonderful position. It's impertive
that Sofi get her queen on that diagonal.} b4 $1 {Black need not initiate the
queen exchange! This move fights for advantage. The useful 13...h6 intending
g5 isn't really an option either because then simply 14. h4! b4 15. Na4 Qxf2
16. Kxf2 a5 17. g4 with advantage for white. After the text Black stands as it
is very active.} 14. Na4 Qxf2+ {Now he must make this exchange. 14. Qa5? just
gets in the way of his queenside pawns.} 15. Kxf2 a5 16. Bb5 $5 {This move is
"ok". However, unless she intends to take on c6 it doesn't have much of a
point. 16. Rac1 seems more natural intending c2-c4. The immediate 16. c4!? is
also possible, but let's not jump the gun. A move like 16. Nd2 also intending
c4 allows 16...g5! Therefore 16. Rac1 seems called for.} Ke7 $1 {The best move.
After the queens are exchange black rightly sees there's no need to castle.}
17. Rhd1 Rhc8 18. c4 $1 {Now we're talking Sofi! I was proud of my friend here.
The bishop doesn't have a "big" chance of being trapped at b5, but, what does
it do there? After this move, white's options increase dramatically and it
gets rid of a weak pawn. In fact this is the only white move to keep an
advantage!} bxc3 {e. p.} 19. bxc3 $1 {Now, white has the b-file and a strong
hold on d4. This is a fine trade-off for the newly weak c-pawn.} Rab8 20. Rab1
{Here, 20. c4?! is interesting, but a positional mistake. The important
feature in the position is the d4 square. Anyway with the pawn on c3, after
Nd4 if Nxd4 then cxd4 fixing the pawn structure anyway. I like Sofi's decision
of leaving the pawn on c3. White has a slight advantage.} Ba8 21. Nd4 f6 $2 {
Very natural. In fact, in all honesty, this was the first move I looked at
here. But this could be the losing mistake and prove Sofi's earlier 16. Bb5
correct. More sensible is 21...Rc7.} 22. exf6+ $6 {I'm sure that Sofi saw 22.
Bxc6, however I think she underestimated its power. It totally solidifies the
knight at d4 and trades into a won endgame. For instance, 22. Bxc6 Bxc6 23.
Rxb8 Nxb8 24. exf6 Kxf6 25. Nb6 Re8 26. Rb1 g6 27. g3 with big advantage. The
black forces are tied down to e6, white still has total control over the d4
square, and black's bishop is bad. Sofi, most likely by instinct, and fear of
how Viktor would respond, played 22. exf6+ intending to hold on to the bishop
pair. Because of this choice, I have no idea why Sofi played 16. Bb5.} Nxf6 23.
Bd3 {Now 24. Bxc6 is bad as black's knight is already on f6. 24. Bxc6? would
just give up Sofi's good bishop. At least Sofi's consistent. :)} e5 $1 {
Powerful. Immediately equalizes and probably earns black the advantage. This
trades off the weak e-pawn.} 24. fxe5 Nxe5 25. Bf5 {
The only move to hold the balance.} Rf8 26. Ke2 {Sofi bringing the king slowly
but surely over to defend c3 while getting off of the f-file where a rook is
aimed right at his majesty. I liked 26. Rb6!? This looked strong because 26...
Rxb6 exchanging rooks would be to white's advantage then. Therefore after 26...
Nc4 27. Re6+ Kf7 28. Ra6 g6 29. Be6+ Ke7 30. Ke2 Nh5 31. g3 Nf6 32. Rf1 Bb7 33.
Ra7 Kd6 34. Rb1 Ba8 35. Ra6+ Ke7 36. Rxb8 Rxb8 37. Nc5 Ne8 38. Ra7+ Kd6 39.
Ne4+! with an endgame advantage.} g6 $1 {
The best move! It's imperitive that Viktor dislodges this strong f5 bishop.}
27. Bd3 Nxd3 {Black earns himself a bishop vs. knight ending and strong
control over the e4 square.} 28. Kxd3 Ne4 29. Re1 Rfc8 30. Nf3 $6 {
I think better is 30. Ne2.} Kd6 31. Nd4 Bc6 $1 {The most important move of the
game! This is the move that wins. 32. Rb5 is a strong threat. I'm not sure
what his time management was like, but I think this must've been one his
longer thinks as this is the beginning of his winning move sequence.} 32. Rxb8
Rxb8 33. Nxc6 Kxc6 34. c4 {The only move.} dxc4+ 35. Kxc4 Nd6+ 36. Kc3 Nb5+ 37.
Kb3 Kd5 {Now the black king has a nice central position, black has the b-file,
which means that the king can't defend the a3 pawn unless it wants to be
trapped.} 38. Nc3+ Nxc3+ 39. Kxc3 a4 {Now the king is officially cut off from
defense of the a-pawn and the b3 square is secure for the black rook.} 40. Re7
$2 {This doesn't help matters for Sofi. Better was 40. Rd1+.} Rb3+ 41. Kc2 Rxa3
42. Rxh7 Ra2+ 43. Kb1 Rxg2 44. h4 Ke6 $1 {The best move. Black let's go of the
a-pawn and concentrates on the kingside and converting his g-pawn.} 45. h5 g5
46. Ra7 Rh2 47. Rxa4 Kf5 48. Kc1 g4 49. Ra5+ Kf4 50. Ra4+ Kg5 51. Kd1 g3 {
No stopping the g-pawn.} 52. Ra8 Kxh5 53. Rg8 Kh4 54. Ke1 Rf2 55. Rh8+ Kg4 56.
Rh1 Rh2 {And Sofi resigned. There's no stopping the g-pawn conversion and
subsequent mate. Sofi played a nice game, missed some winning chances, but I'm
proud of her. As a matter of fact she went on to beat another strong veteran
Smyslov in the 3rd round with a quick 22-mover.} 0-1
